Abstract = {{Previous theoretical studies of C3B have suggested that boron-doped
   graphite is a promising H-2- and Li-storage material, with large maximum
   capacities. These characteristics could lead to exciting applications as
   a lightweight H-2-storage material for automotive engines and as an
   anode in a new generation of batteries. However, for these applications
   to be realized a synthetic route to bulk C3B must be developed. Here we
   show the thermolysis of a single-source precursor (1,3-BBr2)(2)C6H4) to
   produce graphitic C3B, thus allowing the characteristics of this elusive
   material to be tested for the first time. C3B was found to be
   compositionally uniform but turbostratically disordered. Contrary to
   theoretical expectations, the H-2- and Li-storage capacities are lower
   than anticipated, results that can partially be explained by the
   disordered nature of the material. This work suggests that to model the
   properties of graphitic materials more realistically, the possibility of
   disorder must be considered.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the ground-state wave function of a prototypical strongly
   correlated system, a three-band (p-d) Hubbard model of cuprates, using
   full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo. We show that the
   configuration interaction description of the exact ground state wave
   function is profoundly affected by the choice of single-particle
   representation, in a counterintuitive manner. Thus a broken-symmetry
   unrestricted Hartree-Fock basis, which at a single configuration level
   produces a qualitatively correct description of the antiferromagnet,
   results in a highly entangled exact solution consisting of high
   particle-hole excitations of the reference. This wave function is found
   to be very difficult to approximate using subspace diagonalizations.
   Conversely, a restricted Hartree-Fock basis, which yields at a single
   configuration level a qualitatively incorrect paramagnetic metal,
   results in a relatively rapidly converging configuration interaction
   expansion. Convergence can be further accelerated by adopting a natural
   orbital representation. Our results suggest that with the correct
   single-particle basis, such strongly correlated systems may be described
   by relatively compact wave functions.}},

Abstract = {{Properties that are necessarily formulated within pure (symmetric)
   expectation values are difficult to calculate for projector quantum
   Monte Carlo approaches, but are critical in order to compute many of the

   matrices within the full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo

   achieved via an independent replica population of walkers in the
   dynamic, sampled alongside the original population. The resulting
   reduced density matrices are free from systematic error (beyond those
   present via constraints on the dynamic itself) and can be used to
   compute a variety of expectation values and properties, with rapid
   convergence to an exact limit. Aquasi-variational energy estimate
   derived from these density matrices is proposed as an accurate
   alternative to the projected estimator for multiconfigurational
   wavefunctions, while its variational property could potentially lend
   itself to accurate extrapolation approaches in larger systems. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{The initiator full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo method

   Hilbert spaces formed of both canonical restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF)
   and symmetry-broken unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) orbitals. By
   explicit calculation, we demonstrate that the technique yields the same
   total energy for both types of orbital but that as the bond is
   stretched, FCI expansions expressed in unrestricted orbitals are
   substantially more compact than their restricted counterparts and more
   compact than those expressed in split-localized orbitals. These
   unrestricted I-filbert spaces, however, become nonergodic toward the
   dissociation limit, and the total wave function may be thought of as the
   sum of two weakly coupled, spin-impure, functions whose energies are
   nonetheless very close to the exact energy. In this limit, it is a
   challenge for i-FCIQMC to resolve a spin-pure wave function. The use of
   unrestricted natural orbitals is a promising remedy for this problem, as

Journal = {{Mol. Phys.}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{1855}},
Abstract = {{For many decades, quantum chemical method development has been dominated
   by algorithms which involve increasingly complex series of tensor
   contractions over one-electron orbital spaces. Procedures for their
   derivation and implementation have evolved to require the minimum amount
   of logic and rely heavily on computationally efficient library-based
   matrix algebra and optimised paging schemes. In this regard, the recent
   development of exact stochastic quantum chemical algorithms to reduce
   computational scaling and memory overhead requires a contrasting
   algorithmic philosophy, but one which when implemented efficiently can
   achieve higher accuracy/cost ratios with small random errors.
   Additionally, they can exploit the continuing trend for massive
   parallelisation which hinders the progress of deterministic high-level
   quantum chemical algorithms. In the Quantum Monte Carlo community,
   stochastic algorithms are ubiquitous but the discrete Fock space of
   quantum chemical methods is often unfamiliar, and the methods introduce
   new concepts required for algorithmic efficiency. In this paper, we
   explore these concepts and detail an algorithm used for Full
   Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC), which is
   implemented and available in MOLPRO and as a standalone code, and is
   designed for high-level parallelism and linear-scaling with walker
   number. Many of the algorithms are also in use in, or can be transferred
   to, other stochastic quantum chemical methods and implementations. We
   apply these algorithms to the strongly correlated chromium dimer to
   demonstrate their efficiency and parallelism.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of all materials arise largely from the quantum mechanics
   of their constituent electrons under the influence of the electric field
   of the nuclei. The solution of the underlying many-electron Schrodinger
   equation is a `non-polynomial hard' problem, owing to the complex
   interplay of kinetic energy, electron-electron repulsion and the Pauli
   exclusion principle. The dominant computational method for describing
   such systems has been density functional theory. Quantum-chemical
   methods-based on an explicit ansatz for the many-electron wavefunctions
   and, hence, potentially more accurate-have not been fully explored in
   the solid state owing to their computational complexity, which ranges
   from strongly exponential to high-order polynomial in system size. Here
   we report the application of an exact technique, full configuration
   interaction quantum Monte Carlo to a variety of real solids, providing
   reference many-electron energies that are used to rigorously benchmark
   the standard hierarchy of quantum-chemical techniques, up to the `gold
   standard' coupled-cluster ansatz, including single, double and
   perturbative triple particle-hole excitation operators. We show the
   errors in cohesive energies predicted by this method to be small,

Abstract = {{By performing a stochastic dynamic in a space of Slater determinants,
   the full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method
   has been able to obtain energies which are essentially free from
   systematic error to the basis set correlation energy, within small and
   systematically improvable error bars. However, the weakly exponential
   scaling with basis size makes converging the energy with respect to
   basis set costly and in larger systems, impossible. To ameliorate these
   basis set issues, here we use perturbation theory to couple the FCIQMC
   wavefunction to an explicitly correlated strongly orthogonal basis of
   geminals, following the {[}2](R12) approach of Valeev et al. The
   required one- and two-particle density matrices are computed on-the-fly
   during the FCIQMC dynamic, using a sampling procedure which incurs
   relatively little additional computation expense. The F12 energy
   corrections are shown to converge rapidly as a function of sampling,
   both in imaginary time and number of walkers. Our pilot calculations on
   the binding curve for the carbon dimer, which exhibits strong
   correlation effects as well as substantial basis set dependence,
   demonstrate that the accuracy of the FCIQMC-F12 method surpasses that of

Abstract = {{Using the finite simulation-cell homogeneous electron gas (HEG) as a

   simple explanations for the internal parameters of an i-FCIQMC

Abstract = {{The full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method,
   as well as its ``initiator{''} extension (i-FCIQMC), is used to tackle
   the complex electronic structure of the carbon dimer across the entire
   dissociation reaction coordinate, as a prototypical example of a
   strongly correlated molecular system. Various basis sets of increasing
   size up to the large cc-pVQZ are used, spanning a fully accessible
   N-electron basis of over 10(12) Slater determinants, and the accuracy of
   the method is demonstrated in each basis set. Convergence to the FCI
   limit is achieved in the largest basis with only O{[}10(7)] walkers
   within random errorbars of a few tenths of a millihartree across the
   binding curve, and extensive comparisons to FCI, CCSD(T), MRCI, and
   CEEIS results are made where possible. A detailed exposition of the
   convergence properties of the FCIQMC methods is provided, considering
   convergence with elapsed imaginary time, number of walkers and size of

   significantly reducing the scaling with the size of the Slater

Abstract = {{The dispersion energy between extended molecular chains (or equivalently

   expressible as a pair-wise sum of atom-atom terms which decay as R(-6).
   Using a model system of two parallel wires with a variable band gap, we
   show that this is not the case. The dispersion interaction scales as

   but as the band gap decreases the interaction is greatly enhanced; while
   at shorter (but nonoverlapping) separations it approaches a power-law
   scaling given by z(-2), i.e., the dispersion interaction expected
   between metallic wires. We demonstrate that these effects can be
   understood from the increasing length scale of the plasmon modes (charge
   fluctuations), and their increasing contribution to the molecular dipole
   polarizability and the dispersion interaction, as the band gaps are
   reduced. This result calls into question methods which invoke locality

Abstract = {{A new quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method is used to calculate exact, full
   configuration-interaction (FCI) energies of the neutral and cationic
   elements from Li to Mg, in a family of commonly used basis sets.
   Annihilation processes between positive and negative walkers enable the
   exact N-electron wave function to emerge as a linear superposition of
   the (factorially large) space of Slater determinants, with individual
   determinants being stochastically sampled. As a result, extremely large
   spaces (exceeding 10(15) determinants) become accessible for FCI
   calculations. No fixed-node approximation is necessary, and the only
   remaining source of error is the one-electron basis set, which can be
   systematically reduced by enlargement of the basis set. We have
   investigated the family of aug-cc-pVXZ Dunning basis sets up to X=5. The
   resulting ionization potentials are-with one exception (Na)-consistently
   accurate to within chemical accuracy. The anomalous case of Na suggests
   that its basis set may be improvable. Extrapolation schemes are examined

   improvement is seen in the mean-absolute error, the results of

Journal = {{J. Chem. Phys.}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{We provide a very simple adaptation of our recently published quantum
   Monte Carlo algorithm in full configuration-interaction (Slater
   determinant) spaces which dramatically reduces the number of walkers
   required to achieve convergence. A survival criterion is imposed for
   newly spawned walkers. We define a set of initiator determinants such
   that progeny of walkers spawned from such determinants onto unoccupied
   determinants are able to survive, while the progeny of walkers not in
   this set can survive only if they are spawned onto determinants which
   are already occupied. The set of initiators is originally defined to be
   all determinants constructable from a subset of orbitals, in analogy
   with complete-active spaces. This set is dynamically updated so that if
   a noninitiator determinant reaches an occupation larger than a preset
   limit, it becomes an initiator. The new algorithm allows sign-coherent
   sampling of the FCI space to be achieved with relatively few walkers.
   Using the N(2) molecule as an illustration, we show that rather small
   initiator spaces and numbers of walkers can converge with
   submilliHartree accuracy to the known full configuration-interaction
   (FCI) energy (in the cc-pVDZ basis), in both the equilibrium geometry
   and the multiconfigurational stretched case. We use the same method to

Volume = {{131}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a new quantum Monte Carlo method for the simulation of
   correlated many-electron systems in full configuration-interaction
   (Slater determinant) spaces. The new method is a population dynamics of
   a set of walkers, and is designed to simulate the underlying
   imaginary-time Schroumldinger equation of the interacting Hamiltonian.
   The walkers (which carry a positive or negative sign) inhabit Slater
   determinant space, and evolve according to a simple set of rules which
   include spawning, death and annihilation processes. We show that this
   method is capable of converging onto the full configuration-interaction
   (FCI) energy and wave function of the problem, without any a priori
   information regarding the nodal structure of the wave function being
   provided. Walker annihilation is shown to play a key role. The pattern
   of walker growth exhibits a characteristic plateau once a critical
   (system-dependent) number of walkers has been reached. At this point,
   the correlation energy can be measured using two independent methods-a
   projection formula and a energy shift; agreement between these provides
   a strong measure of confidence in the accuracy of the computed
   correlation energies. We have verified the method by performing
   calculations on systems for which FCI calculations already exist. In
   addition, we report on a number of new systems, including CO, O(2),

Abstract = {{Li-N-H compounds hold promise as novel hydrogen-storage materials with
   high gravimetric hydrogen densities. Because the dehydriding reaction
   caused by the decomposition of LiNH2 requires a higher temperature than
   desired, much effort has been devoted to the destabilization of LiNH2 to
   decrease the decomposition temperature. In particular, there has been
   recent experimental evidence for lowering the temperature by partial
   substitution of Li by Mg. However, the reason is not clear. In this
   study, we have employed density functional theory to investigate LiNH2
   and partially Li-substituted systems aiming to understand the effects of
   the substitution on the destabilization of the NH2 species. K, a more
   electropositive element, and Mg, a more electronegative element, have
   been chosen as two probes to illustrate the effects. We have focused on
   the investigation of effects of substitutions on the N-H bond strength
   that is regarded as a qualitative indicator of the decomposition
   temperature. We have found that in both cases the N-H bonds are
   weakened, in particular, the Mg substitute appears to be more effective
   in the destabilization of the NH2. The relative strength of the metal-N
   ionic bonding has been found to be a key factor to explain the effects
   of the substitutes. These have been discussed in detail in terms of
   Wannier function analyses.}},

   stability of the two states depends on the temperature and partial

   stable configurations are those forming carbon clusters. However, the
   nickel sites hosting these clusters change from hexagonal close

   pseudopotential method. The clean surface and several oxidized surfaces
   have been investigated, with oxygen coverages up to 2 ML of oxygen (I ML

   in terms of equilibrium thermodynamics, with a comparison of the free
   energies of several surfaces of different composition, implemented at
   the atomic scale. Three environmental parameters are singled out as
   control variables in this treatment, namely the alloy composition x
   (assumed to be near 0.5), the temperature T and the partial pressure of
   oxygen p(O2), With certain reasonable approximations an analytic formula
   for the surface energy sigma is derived in terms of these variables and
   some constants that are calculated ab initio together with others that

   explain the observed formation of a thin film of alumina in place of
   NiAl surface layers, with the consequent dissolution of Ni into the

Abstract = {{Proton order is less constrained in a fully H-bonded, adsorbed H2O

   to(1)/(2)k(B) In(9/2), almost twice that of ice Ih. Thus, at 150 K,
   where periodic adlayers on metals are observed, residual entropy reduces
   their free energies relative to a 3-D ice crystal by 4.5 meV/molecule,
   or similar to3\% of the cost of the adlayers' broken H-bonds. A Debye
   model implies that vibrational entropy contributes no more than another
   4.4 meV/molecule to the free energy preference for wetting, at 150 K.
   This information, though only a bound because of substantial uncertainty

Abstract = {{The stability of missing-row reconstructions of (110) surfaces with

   theory, taking Pt and Au as representative systems. A thermodynamic
   formulation is derived to compare the relative stability of charged
   surfaces either in constant-potential or constant-charge mode. By
   generalizing Koopmans' theorem to charged metallic surfaces, we obtain
   an expression for the surface (excess) energy as a function of charge
   (or potential) in terms of the neutral surface energy, work function,
   and the position of the image plane. A surface is shown to reconstruct
   in constant-charge mode if and only if it reconstructs in
   constant-potential mode. We next address the question of whether a
   positive (negative) surface charge can lift (induce) the reconstruction,
   as suggested in the literature. This turns out not to be the case.
   Instead the following consistent picture arises: at small surface
   charges, the effect of the charge follows the difference of the work
   functions; i.e., positive charge favors a surface having a smaller work
   function and vice versa. Larger charges, either positive or negative,
   tend to stabilize the reconstructed surface or, more generally, the 1xr
   reconstruction with larger r. The latter essentially results in that the
   1x2 reconstruction in either Pt or Au is never lifted in our study,
   although the 1x3 surface in Au eventually becomes more stable.}},

   fixed pressure and temperature T = P = 0), we computed the enthalpy of
   formation DeltaH(f)(x) of the (non)stoichiometric systems. In the regime
   x = 0 --> 1, the DeltaH(f)(x) decrease in a manner indicative of the
   existence of attractive interactions between the dissolved H atoms.
   Ideal-solution theory cannot be applied to this system. Furthermore, we
   find that tetrahedral occupation is favoured over octahedral occupation
   at high x, leading to the formation of a zincblende structure at x = 1.
   A preliminary vibrational analysis of normal modes has been performed.
   Inclusion of vibrational zero-point energies in a harmonic approximation
   leads us to conclude, tentatively, that the observed stability of
   octahedral site occupation is due to more favourable zero-point energies
   of the H atoms in those sites. The results indicate that a proper
   understanding of this system must take into account the quantum nature
   of the dissolved hydrogen.}},

Abstract = {We have performed path-integral Monte Carlo calculations to study He-4

   constructed by Carlos and Cole to fit helium scattering data from a
   graphite surface. We employed both an anisotropic 6-12 Lennard-Jones
   potential and a spherical 6-12 potential. For both potentials, the first
   He-4 layer has the C-1/3 commensurate structure at a surface density of
   0.0636 angstrom(-2). Vacancy states created in the C-1/3 commensurate
   solid, however, behave differently depending on the He-4-substrate
   interaction: a cluster of localized vacancies are formed with the fully
   anisotropic 6-12 pair potentials while mobile vacancies are found to
   induce finite superfluid fractions with the substrate potential based on
   only the isotropic parts of the inter-atomic pair potentials. For the
   second helium layer we find that exchange among He-4 adatoms results in
   quantum melting of a C-7/12 commensurate structure, which is registered
   to a first-layer triangular solid. The possible stabilization of this

   presented. We study the system at T = 1 K and between 14 and 128 He-4
   atoms. For all studied systems, we find that the ion is well localized
   at the center of the droplet with the formation of a ``snowball{''} of
   well-defined shells of localized He-4 atoms forming solid-like order in
   at least the first surrounding shell. The number of surrounding helium
   shells (two or three) and the number of atoms per shell and the degree
   of localization of the helium atoms are sensitive to the type of ion.
   The number of He-4 atoms in the first shell varies from 12 for Na+ to 18
   for Mg+ and depends weakly on the size of the droplet. The study of the
   density profile and of the angular correlations shows that the local
   solid-like order is more pronounced for the alkali ions with Na+ giving
   a very stable icosahedral order extending up to three shells.}},

Abstract = {{We study the phase diagram of an effective ion model of fully ionized
   hydrogen at ultra-high pressure. We assume that the protons interact
   with a screened Coulomb potential derived from a static linear response
   theory. This model accurately reproduces the physical properties of
   hydrogen for densities greater than rho(m) = 10 g/cm(3) corresponding to
   the range of the coupling parameter r(s) less than or similar to 0.6.
   The pressure range, P greater than or similar to 20T Pa, is well beyond
   present experimental limitations. Assuming classical protons, we find
   that the zero temperature enthalpy of the perfect bcc crystal is
   slightly lower than for other structures at rho(m) = 12.47 g/cm(3) while
   the fcc structure gains stability at higher density. Using Monte Carlo
   calculations, we compute the free energy of various phases and locate
   the melting transition versus density. We find that on melting, bcc is
   energetically favored with respect to fcc over the entire range
   investigated. In the solid phase the system undergoes a structural
   transition from bcc at higher temperature to fcc at lower temperature.
   The free energy difference between these two structures is very small so
   that obtaining a quantitative estimate of this second transition line
   requires accuracy beyond that provided by our method. We estimate the
   effect of proton zero point motion on the bcc melting line for hydrogen,
   deuterium, and tritium by a path integral Monte Carlo method. Although
   zero point effects on hydrogen are large, since the two competing phases
   (bcc and liquid) have locally similar environments, the effect on the
   melting line is small; the melting temperature for hydrogen is lowered
   by about 10\% with respect to the classical value. (C) 2011 American

Abstract = {{Recent progress in simulation methodologies and in computer power allow
   first-principles simulations of condensed systems with Born-Oppenheimer
   electronic energies obtained by quantum Monte Carlo methods. Computing
   free energies and therefore getting a quantitative determination of
   phase diagrams is one step more demanding in terms of computer
   resources. In this paper we derive a general relation to compute the
   free energy of an ab initio model with Reptation Quantum Monte Carlo
   (RQMC) energies from the knowledge of the free energy of the same ab
   initio model in which the electronic energies are computed by the less
   demanding but less accurate Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method.
   Moreover we devise a procedure to correct transition lines based on the
   use of the new relation. In order to illustrate the procedure, we
   consider the liquid-liquid phase transition in hydrogen, a first-order
   transition between a lower pressure, molecular and insulating phase and
   a higher pressure, partially dissociated and conducting phase. We
   provide new results along the T = 600 K isotherm across the phase
   transition and find good agreement between the transition pressure and
   specific volumes at coexistence for the model with RQMC accuracy between
   the prediction of our procedure and the values that can be directly
   inferred from the observed plateau in the pressure-volume curve along
   the isotherm. This work paves the way for future use of VMC in
   first-principles simulations of high-pressure hydrogen, an essential
   simplification when considering larger system sizes or quantum proton

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are often used to calculate properties
   of many body quantum systems. The main cost of many QMC methods, for
   example, the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method, is in constructing a
   sequence of Slater matrices and computing the ratios of determinants for
   successive Slater matrices. Recent work has improved the scaling of
   constructing Slater matrices for insulators so that the cost of
   constructing Slater matrices in these systems is now linear in the
   number of particles, whereas computing determinant ratios remains cubic
   in the number of particles. With the long term aim of simulating much
   larger systems, we improve the scaling of computing the determinant
   ratios in the VMC method for simulating insulators by using
   preconditioned iterative solvers. The main contribution of this paper is
   the development of a method to efficiently compute for the Slater
   matrices a sequence of preconditioners that make the iterative solver
   converge rapidly. This involves cheap preconditioner updates, an
   effective reordering strategy, and a cheap method to monitor instability
   of incomplete LU decomposition with threshold and pivoting (ILUTP)
   preconditioners. Using the resulting preconditioned iterative solvers to
   compute determinant ratios of consecutive Slater matrices reduces the
   scaling of QMC algorithms from O(n(3)) per sweep to roughly O(n(2)),
   where n is the number of particles, and a sweep is a sequence of n
   steps, each attempting to move a distinct particle. We demonstrate
   experimentally that we can achieve the improved scaling without
   increasing statistical errors. Our results show that preconditioned
   iterative solvers can dramatically reduce the cost of VMC for large(r)
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{We calculate the momentum distribution of the Fermi-liquid phase of the

   Fermi surface, the momentum distribution of a finite system with N
   electrons approaches its thermodynamic limit slowly, with leading-order
   corrections scaling as N(-1/4). These corrections dominate the
   extrapolation of the renormalization factor Z and the single-particle
   effective mass m({*}) to the infinite system size. We show how
   convergence can be improved using analytical corrections. In the range 1
   <= r(s)<= 10, we get a lower renormalization factor Z and a higher
   effective mass m({*})>m compared to the perturbative random-phase

Abstract = {{Using exact continuous quantum Monte Carlo techniques, we study the
   zero- and finite-temperature properties of a system of harmonically
   trapped one-dimensional spin-1/2 fermions with short-range
   interactions. Motivated by experimental searches for modulated
   Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinikov states, we systematically examine the
   impact of a spin imbalance on the density profiles. We quantify the
   accuracy of the Thomas-Fermi approximation, finding that for
   sufficiently large particle numbers (N greater than or similar to 100)
   it quantitatively reproduces most features of the exact density
   profile. The Thomas-Fermi approximation fails to capture small
   Friedel-like spin and density oscillations and overestimates the size
   of the fully paired region in the outer shell of the trap. Based on our
   results, we suggest a range of experimentally tunable parameters to
   maximize the visibility of the double-shell structure of the system and
   the Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinikov state in the one-dimensional

   calculations of ring exchange energies on `clean' two-dimensional

   ferromagnetic in the semi-classical limit (strong coupling) and anti
   ferro magnetic near the melting transition where the relative exchange
   energies become equivalent. We focus here on the importance of
   long-ring exchanges near the melting transition. The total energy

Abstract = {{We describe a method to evaluate electronic forces by path integral
   Monte Carlo (PIMC) calculation. Electronic correlations, as well as
   thermal effects, are included naturally in this method. For fermions, a
   restricted approach is used to avoid the ``sign{''} problem. The PIMC
   force estimator is local and has a finite variance. We applied this
   method to determine the bond length of H-2 and the chemical reaction
   barrier of H + H-2 --> H-2 + H. At low temperature, good agreement is
   obtained with ground-state calculations. We studied the proton-proton
   interaction in an electron gas as a simple model for hydrogen impurities
   in metals. We calculated the force between the two protons at two
   electronic densities corresponding to Na (r(s) = 3.93) and Al (r(s) =
   2.07) using a supercell with 38 electrons. The result is compared to
   previous calculations. We also studied the effect of temperature on the
   proton-proton interaction. At very high temperature, our result agrees
   with the Debye screening of electrons. As temperature decreases, the
   Debye theory fails both because of the strong degeneracy of electrons
   and most importantly, the formation of electronic bound states around
   the protons. {[}S1063-651X(98)07710-1].}},

Abstract = {{Energies of the ground state and low-lying excited states of the
   two-dimensional electron gas have been calculated by a
   transient-estimate Monte Carlo method. This is an exact fermion quantum
   Monte Carlo method that systematically improves upon the results of a
   variational energy without imposing nodal constraints. We focus upon the
   density r(s)=1, where our previous variational Monte Carlo calculation
   found qualitative differences in the effective mass from other
   theoretical approaches. Starting from a wave function with backflow and
   two-body correlations, the best trial function in our previous
   variational study, we find a ground-state energy only very slightly
   lower than the previously reported backflow fixed-node energy,
   reinforcing the conclusion that backflow wave functions are quite
   accurate. The effective mass derived from excitation energies does not
   differ significantly from the variational Monte Carlo results, giving a
   value of m{*}/m=0.93+/-0.01, so we conclude that the effective mass is
   indeed less than bare electron mass for a range of densities around
   r(s)=1.}},

   evaporate significantly at temperatures above 2 K. We also calculate

   the case where the real acid reciprocal space sums are truncated. We
   derive a criterion which is used to determine the accuracy of a given
   approximation and use this criterion to determine the optimal separation
   of a very general class of potentials, subject to cutoffs, k(c),and
   r(c), in reciprocal and real space, respectively. Using a basis of
   locally piecewise-quintic Hermite interpolants, we demonstrate our
   procedure and show that for the Coulomb potential, the error is
   proportional to exp(-k(c)r(c)). At typical cutoff Values we find the
   optimized breakup to be two orders of magnitude more accurate than the
   standard Ewald breakup for a given computational effort. (C) 1995

   importanced-sampled zero-temperature quantum Monte Carlo simulations.
   The analysis includes two steps. First, that spectral overlap function
   and ground state energy which maximizes the entropy and agrees with the
   QMC correlation functions is obtained. Then the errors in the energy are
   evaluated by averaging over all the possible images (average MaxEnt

   way consistent with fundamental probabilistic hypotheses. This allows us
   to fully exploit the information contained in the correlation functions

Journal = {{TOPICS IN APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{1992}},

Pages = {{205-248}},
Abstract = {{In this chapter we review the progress that has been made since the
   publication of the previous articles {[}7.1, 2] hereafter referred to as
   I and II. The major advances not covered in those two reviews are
   improved variational wave-functions, path integral methods for
   calculating at temperatures T > 0, systems with interfaces such as
   surfaces and droplets, and the calculation of exchange frequencies in
   quantum crystals. We will concentrate on these areas and on the Monte
   Carlo techniques used. We will give results from some representative
   calculations.
   The principle constituents of the systems we describe are the helium
   isotopes He-3 and He-4. Other many-body quantum systems such as electron
   systems, polarised hydrogen and its isotopes, can be handled in a
   similar way. Systems with spin and/or isospin dependent forces like
   nuclei are much more difficult and require nontrivial generalisations of
   the techniques presented here, and are beyond the scope of this work.
   The interested reader is referred to the recent work by Pieper et al.
   {[}7.3] and Carlson {[}7.4,5] for some current Monte Carlo attacks on
   the nuclear structure problem.
   The Hamiltonian we consider is
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   with obvious generalisations to mixtures, substrates, three-body
   potentials, etc. We set HBAR = 1, m is the mass, and v(ij) = v
   (\textbackslash{}r(i) - r(j)\textbackslash{}) is the pair potential.
   Throughout this work we denote the 3N coordinates of the N atoms by R.
   We will describe, in Sect. 7.1 some wavefunctions used currently in
   variational studies. These include 3-body and backflow correlations in
   addition to the standard Bijl-Dingle-Jastrow form of the many-body
   wavefunction; the pairing forms for thc wavefunction developed by
   Bouchaud and Lhuillier {[}7.6]; and the shadow wavefunctions of Vitiello
   et al. {[}7.7]. We will also discuss some useful optimisation methods.
   In Sect. 7.2, we will define the Green's functions Monte Carlo (GFMC)
   method and briefly discuss some fermion methods. The path integral Monte
   Carlo (PIMC) method, which has been developed and applied since I and II
   were published, will be described in Sect. 7.3. We will give some
   results of calculations of helium bulk properties in Sect. 7.4, and
   momentum distributions and related density matrices in Sect. 7.5. In
   Sect. 7.6, we will give an introduction to some work on droplets, and
   Sect. 7.7 give some possible future directions for Monte Carlo
   simulations of quantum fluids.
   Techniques other than Monte Carlo simulations have made important
   contributions to the understanding of many systems and particularly in
   the development of good variational wavefunctions. However, we will only
   refer to these methods when they have a direct bearing on the Monte
   Carlo development.
   Some systematic errors are common to all of the Monte-Carlo calculations
   we describe. These include the interaction potential, size dependence,
   statistical errors, convergence problems and bias.
   The 2-body HFDHE2 potential of Aziz et al. {[}7.8] has become the
   potential of choice for helium studies in part because of the good
   agreement between GFMC ground-state calculations and the experimental
   low-temperature equation of state for He-4. The potential needs to be
   revised by softening the core {[}7.9, 10] and Aziz and coworkers have
   published a new He-He potential {[}7.11]. The attractive well may have
   to be deepened somewhat {[}7.11,12], although the evidence here is much
   less compelling, and the HFDHE2 well depth is within estimated
   theoretical bounds. In any case, the HFDHE2 potential is accurate to
   better than 0.2 K per particle out of the 20 K potential energy in He-4
   at equilibrium density. Three-body potential effects are not well
   characterised, but estimates {[}7.13], mostly based on the
   Axilrod-Teller interaction {[}7.14], show that they are also in this
   range. Work at much higher pressures will require a better understanding
   of these 3-body forces. Recent attempts to calculate, using the Monte
   Carlo method, the 2- and 3-body helium interaction potentials have been
   successful in the highly repulsive region {[}7.9], but have not been
   conclusive in the region of the attractive well because the statistical
   errors have been of order 0.1 K {[}7.15-17].
   Size dependence of the ground state energy and local properties of bulk
   He-4 are small as stated in 1. However, the momentum distribution as
   usually calculated, has the incorrect behaviour at long wavelength
   {[}7.18], and the specific heat curve is rounded around the lambda
   transition {[}7.19]. These are a direct consequence of the finite size
   of the simulations used. As we shall see in Sect. 7.3, PIMC calculations
   which need to sample paths with a change in the winding number, are
   currently limited to small systems (100 atoms). In the fermi system
   He-3, shell effects due to the very nonspherical fermi surface can be
   quite large {[}7.20,21], of order 0.1 K per particle even for N over
   100. These will make difficult the extraction from Monte Carlo
   calculations of a number of interesting properties such as the spin
   susceptibility and the effective mass.
   Statistical errors, lack of convergence, and bias of the Monte Carlo
   calculations can also be a major problem; witness the GFMC density
   profiles calculated for droplets {[}7.22, 23] and for the free surface
   {[}7.24]. Here the slow convergence makes difficult the calculation of
   the exact ground-state density from the variational and GFMC mixed
   estimates. Clearly, the extrapolation from the variational and GFMC
   mixed estimates described in I and II should only be trusted when
   variational and mixed estimates are close so that the neglected second
   order error term can be assumed small. An advantage of PIMC over GFMC is
   that this extrapolation is not needed. A possible combination of GFMC
   and PIMC can be made by replacing the closed path by a path which ends
   with a good variational trial wave function. The resulting method would
   combine, for zero temperature problems, some of the advantages and
   disadvantages of the GFMC, PIMC and shadow wavefunction methods.
   Great care needs to be taken in all Monte Carlo calculations to
   eliminate the effects of bias, autocorrelation, and lack of convergence.
   Much of the advice given by Binder, Stauffer and Heermann {[}7.25,26]
   can be applied directly to quantum simulations.}},

Abstract = {{A method for accelerating the rate of convergence of the long-time (or
   small-temperature) limit of quantum Monte Carlo approaches is presented.
   To do that, a variation of the Lanczos algorithm suitable for QMC data
   is introduced. This algorithm allows one to extract more information
   from correlation functions at small times, thus avoiding large
   statistical fluctuations associated with large times. It is first
   applied to an exactly soluble system and then to the LiH molecule.
   Calculations using both the fixed-node and nodal-release approaches are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {We have applied the technique of evaluating a nonlocal pseudopotential
   with a trial function to give an approximate, local many-body
   pseudopotential which was used in a valence-only diffusion Monte Carlo
   (DMC) calculation.  The pair and triple correlation terms in the trial
   function have been carefully optimized to minimize the effect of the
   locality approximation.  We discuss the accuracy and computational
   demands of the nonlocal pseudopotential evaluation for the DMC method. 
   Calculations of Si, Sc, and Cu ionic and atomic states and the Si2 dimer
   are reported.  In most cases approximately 90\% of the correlation
   energy was recovered at the variational level and excellent estimations
   of the ground state energies were obtained by the DMC simulations.  The
   small statistical error allowed us to determine the quality of the
   assumed pseudopotentials by comparison of the DMC results with
   experimental values.},

   Carlo methods.  It is proved that fermion nodal regions have a tiling
   property, there is only one distinct kind of nodal region.  All others
   are related to it by permutational symmetry.  For some free particle
   systems, it is shown that there are only two nodal regions.  An explicit
   form for the nodes of the many-fermion density matrix would enable exact
   simulations to be carried out at finite temperature.  In the
   high-temperature limit, its nodes are related to Voronoi polyhedra. 
   Two-dimensional cross sections of nodes are depicted.  General
   computable families of fermion wave functions and density matrices are

Abstract = {{We provide a pedagogical introduction to the two main variants of real-space quantum Monte
Carlo methods for electronic-structure calculations: variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and dif-
fusion Monte Carlo (DMC). Assuming no prior knowledge on the subject, we review in depth
the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm used in VMC for sampling the square of an approximate
wave function, discussing details important for applications to electronic systems. We also re-
view in detail the more sophisticated DMC algorithm within the fixed-node approximation,
introduced to avoid the infamous Fermionic sign problem, which allows one to sample a more
accurate approximation to the ground-state wave function. Throughout this review, we discuss
the statistical methods used for evaluating expectation values and statistical uncertainties. In
particular, we show how to estimate nonlinear functions of expectation values and their statis-
tical uncertainties.}},

@article{Sharma2016b,
abstract = {We present two efficient and intruder-free methods for treating dynamic correlation on top of general multi-configuration reference wave functions---including such as obtained by the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) with large active spaces. The new methods are the second order variant of the recently proposed multi-reference linearized coupled cluster method (MRLCC) [S. Sharma, A. Alavi, J. Chem. Phys. 143, 102815 (2015)], and of N-electron valence perturbation theory (NEVPT2), with expected accuracies similar to MRCI+Q and (at least) CASPT2, respectively. Great efficiency gains are realized by representing the first-order wave function with a combination of internal contraction (IC) and matrix product state perturbation theory (MPSPT). With this combination, only third order reduced density matrices (RDMs) are required. Thus, we obviate the need for calculating (or estimating) RDMs of fourth or higher order; these had so far posed a severe bottleneck for dynamic correlation treatments involving the large active spaces accessible to DMRG. Using several benchmark systems, including first and second row containing small molecules, Cr{\$}{\_}2{\$}, pentacene and oxo-Mn(Salen), we shown that active spaces containing at least 30 orbitals can be treated using this method. On a single node, MRLCC2 and NEVPT2 calculations can be performed with over 550 and 1100 virtual orbitals, respectively. We also critically examine the errors incurred due to the three sources of errors introduced in the present implementation - calculating second order instead of third order energy corrections, use of internal contraction and approximations made in the reference wavefunction due to DMRG.},

@article{BenBesHoyMay-JCP-11,
abstract = {A selected multireference configuration interaction (CI) method and the corresponding code are presented. It is based on a procedure of localization that permits to obtain well localized occupied and virtual orbitals. Due to the local character of the electron correlation, using local orbitals allows one to neglect long range interactions. In a first step, three topological matrices are constructed, which determine whether two orbitals must be considered as interacting or not. Two of them concern the truncation of the determinant basis, one for occupied/virtual, the second one for dispersive interactions. The third one concerns the truncation of the list of two electron integrals. This approach permits a fine analysis of each kind of approximation and induces a huge reduction of the CI size and of the computational time. The procedure is tested on linear polyene aldehyde chains, dissociation potential energy curve, and reaction energy of a pesticide-Ca(2+) complex and finally on transition energies of a large iron system presenting a light-induced excited spin-state trapping effect.},

Hartree-Fock (HF) is not guaranteed to find the global minimum-energy determinant, and \textsc{Molpro} switches the occupied orbitals and the symmetry of the HF determinant from $^1\Sigma^+_g$ to $^1\Delta_g$ near $r=3.30$ Bohr if the HF calculations at each distance are done without providing input orbitals (although the $^1\Delta_g$ is the lower energy HF state for $r > 2.20$ Bohr).
This results in a discontinuity in the Hartree-Fock energy, and smaller discontinuities in the CCSD(T) and HCI energies since these methods use the HF orbitals.
Of course in the $\epsilon_1 \to 0$, $\epsilon_2 \to 0$ limit, the HCI energies would not have a discontinuity since the FCI energy is invariant to orbital rotations.
Note that if the HF calculation was done using D$_{\infty h}$ symmetry then there would be only a derivative discontinuity at the curve crossing
in the HF energy, but there would still be discontinuities in the CCSD(T) and HCI energies because of the discontinuity in the HF orbitals.}

abstract = {Catalase mimics can be used as therapeutic agents against oxidative stress in treatment of many diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, stroke, heart disease, aging, and cancer. (Salen)Mn(III) compounds have been proven to be promising as synthetic antioxidants that, in particular, dismutate H2O2, resulting in two water molecules and oxygen. An understanding of the mechanism of the dismutation process is an important basis for rational design and tuning these analogues to yield better therapeutic properties. In addition, the study of the catalytic mechanism of the functional biomimetics of enzymes might contribute to a better understanding of the complex enzymatic activities for the corresponding biological compounds. For the first time, using the density functional theory method, we have performed a quantum chemical investigation of the catalase activity of the (salen)Mn(III) compound. The real compound reacting with a peroxide molecule has been utilized in the calculations to avoid uncertainties connected with using incomplete models. The reaction has been studied on three different spin potential energy surfaces:  the singlet, the triplet, and the quintet. The same H2O2 dismutation process has been also calculated with participation of an additional water molecule to check the possible explicit involvement of the solvent molecules in the proton-transfer process in the course of the reaction. Our findings suggest that the first part of the dismutation reactionthe metal oxidation by a peroxide moleculeis a one-step process. The concerted breaking of the O−O peroxide bond, oxidation of the Mn, and a water molecule formation occur on the triplet state potential energy surface. This process can be done effectively at the Mn catalytic center with only 3.6 kcal/mol of activation energy needed. No energetic advantages were found for the assisted proton-transfer mechanism with participation of an ancillary water molecule. Although the singlet state is not accessible on the reactant and TS parts of the reaction potential surface, it becomes the ground state in the vicinity of the final geometry and can play an important role in the second part of the dismutation process.

abstract = {The (salen)Mn(III)-catalyzed epoxidation reaction mechanism has been investigated using density functional theory (DFT). There is considerable interest in and controversy over the mechanism of this reaction. The results of experimental studies have offered some support for three different reaction mechanisms:  concerted, stepwise radical, and metallooxetane mediated. In this paper, a theoretical examination of the reaction suggests a novel mechanism that describes the reaction as a multichannel process combining both concerted and stepwise radical pathways. The competing channels have different spin states:  the singlet, the triplet, and the quintet. The singlet reaction pathway corresponds to a concerted mechanism and leads exclusively to a cis epoxide product. In contrast, the triplet and quintet reactions follow a stepwise mechanism and lead to a product mixture of cis and trans epoxides. We show that the experimentally observed dependence of isomer product ratios on electronic effects connected with the substitution of the catalyst ligands is due to changing the relative position and, hence, the relative activities of the channels with different cis−trans yields. Because the results and conclusions of the present work dramatically differ from the results and conclusion of the recent DFT theoretical investigation (Linde, C.; Akermark, B; Norrby, P.-O.; Svensson, M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 5083.), we studied possible sources for the deep contradictions between the two works. The choice of the DFT functional and a model has been shown to be crucial for accurate results. Using high level ab initio calculations (coupled cluster-CCSD(T)), we show that the computational procedure employed in this study generates significantly more reliable numerical results. It is also shown that the smaller cationic model without a chlorine ligand that was used by Linde et al. is too oversimplified with respect to our larger neutral model. For this reason, using the cationic model led to a qualitatively wrong quintet reaction profile that played a key role in theoretical postulates in the earlier work.

abstract = {We have developed a new quantum Monte Carlo method for the simulation of correlated many-electron systems in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces. The new method is a population dynamics of a set of walkers, and is designed to simulate the underlying imaginary-time Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation of the interacting Hamiltonian. The walkers (which carry a positive or negative sign) inhabit Slater determinant space, and evolve according to a simple set of rules which include spawning, death and annihilation processes. We show that this method is capable of converging onto the full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy and wave function of the problem, without any a priori information regarding the nodal structure of the wave function being provided. Walker annihilation is shown to play a key role. The pattern of walker growth exhibits a characteristic plateau once a critical (system-dependent) number of walkers has been reached. At this point, the correlation energy can be measured using two independent methods--a projection formula and a energy shift; agreement between these provides a strong measure of confidence in the accuracy of the computed correlation energies. We have verified the method by performing calculations on systems for which FCI calculations already exist. In addition, we report on a number of new systems, including CO, O(2), CH(4), and NaH--with FCI spaces ranging from 10(9) to 10(14), whose FCI energies we compute using modest computational resources.},

abstract = {A configuration selection method for CI calculations is discussed and applied in which the energy lowering produced in a secular equation by the addition of a given test species to a series of dominant configurations is used as an ordering parameter. Configurations with energy lowerings below a given energy cut-off value are not included in the final secular equations but instead a method of estimating the combined effect of the neglected species on the corresponding non-selected CI results is developed. The influence of the choice of main configurations used in the selection process is given close examination as well as the importance of the MO basis employed in the treatment as a whole; in the latter case a non-iterative procedure for obtaining approximate natural orbitals for such calculations is suggested. The resulting configuration selection procedure is equally applicable to all types of electronic states in any nuclear geometry and the results of the associated CI calculations are seen to be essentially equivalent to a complete treatment in which all single- and double-excitation species with respect to aseries of dominant configurations in a given state are included.},

abstract = {Current descriptions of the ab initio DMRG algorithm use two superficially different languages: an older language of the renormalization group and renormalized operators, and a more recent language of matrix product states and matrix product operators. The same algorithm can appear dramatically different when written in the two different vocabularies. In this work, we carefully describe the translation between the two languages in several contexts. First, we describe how to efficiently implement the ab-initio DMRG sweep using a matrix product operator based code, and the equivalence to the original renormalized operator implementation. Next we describe how to implement the general matrix product operator/matrix product state algebra within a pure renormalized operator-based DMRG code. Finally, we discuss two improvements of the ab initio DMRG sweep algorithm motivated by matrix product operator language: Hamiltonian compression, and a sum over operators representation that allows for perfect computational parallelism. The connections and correspondences described here serve to link the future developments with the past, and are important in the efficient implementation of continuing advances in ab initio DMRG and related algorithms.},

abstract = {We provide a very simple adaptation of our recently published quantum Monte Carlo algorithm in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces which dramatically reduces the number of walkers required to achieve convergence. A survival criterion is imposed for newly spawned walkers. We define a set of initiator determinants such that progeny of walkers spawned from such determinants onto unoccupied determinants are able to survive, while the progeny of walkers not in this set can survive only if they are spawned onto determinants which are already occupied. The set of initiators is originally defined to be all determinants constructable from a subset of orbitals, in analogy with complete-active spaces. This set is dynamically updated so that if a noninitiator determinant reaches an occupation larger than a preset limit, it becomes an initiator. The new algorithm allows sign-coherent sampling of the FCI space to be achieved with relatively few walkers. Using the N(2) molecule as an illustration, we show that rather small initiator spaces and numbers of walkers can converge with submilliHartree accuracy to the known full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy (in the cc-pVDZ basis), in both the equilibrium geometry and the multiconfigurational stretched case. We use the same method to compute the energy with cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ basis sets, the latter having an FCI space of over 10(15) with very modest computational resources.},

We have assessed their accuracy and stability of convergence in complete-active-space DMRG calculations on the low-lying excited states in the acenes ranging from naphthalene to pentacene. We find that both algorithms offer increased accuracy over the traditional state-averaged Davidson approach, and, in particular, the state-averaged harmonic Davidson algorithm offers an optimal combination of accuracy and stability in convergence.},

abstract = {Simple closed-form expressions are derived for the "same vacuum" renormalization terms that arise in state-specific multireference coupled cluster (MRCC) theories. Explicit equations are provided for these coupling terms through the triple excitation level of MRCC theory, and a general expression is included for arbitrary-order excitations. The first production-level code (PSIMRCC) for state-specific and rigorously size-extensive Mukherjee multireference coupled cluster singles and doubles (MkCCSD) computations has been written. This code is also capable of evaluating analogous Brillouin-Wigner multireference energies (BWCCSD), including a posteriori size-extensivity corrections. Using correlation-consistent basis sets (cc-pVXZ, X=D,T,Q), MkCCSD and BWCCSD were tested and compared on two classic multireference problems: (1) the dissociation potential curve of molecular fluorine (F(2)) and (2) the structure and vibrational frequencies of ozone. Comparison with experimental data shows that the Mukherjee method is generally superior to the Brillouin-Wigner theory in predicting energies, structures, and vibrational frequencies. Particularly accurate results for F(2) are obtained by applying the MkCCSD method with localized molecular orbitals. Although the MkCCSD theory greatly improves upon single-reference CCSD for the geometric parameters and a(1) vibrational frequencies of ozone, the antisymmetric stretching frequency omega(3)(b(2)) remains pathological and cannot be properly treated without the inclusion of connected triple excitations. Finally, preliminary multireference MkCCSD results are reported for the singlet-triplet splittings in ortho-, meta-, and para-benzyne, coming within 1.5 kcal mol(-1) of experiment in all cases.},

abstract = {The internally contracted multireference coupled cluster (ic-MRCC) approach is formulated using a new wave function ansatz based on a sequential transformation of the reference function (sqic-MRCC). This alternative wave function simplifies the formulation of computationally viable methods while preserving the accuracy of the ic-MRCC approach. The structure of the sqic-MRCC wave function allows folding the effect of the single excitations into a similarity-transformed Hamiltonian whose particle rank is equal to the one of the Hamiltonian. Consequently, we formulate an approximation to the sqic-MRCC method with singles and doubles (included respectively up to fourfold and twofold commutators, sqic-MRCCSD[2]) that contains all terms present in the corresponding single-reference coupled cluster scheme. Computations of the potential energy curves for the dissociation of BeH(2) show that the untruncated sqic-MRCCSD scheme yields results that are almost indistinguishable from the ordinary ic-MRCCSD method. The energy obtained from the computationally less expensive sqic-MRCCSD[2] approximation is found to deviate from the full ic-MRCCSD method by less than 0.2 mE(h) for BeH(2), while, in the case of water, the harmonic vibrational frequencies of ozone, the singlet-triplet splitting of p-benzyne, and the dissociation curve of N(2), sqic-MRCCSD[2] faithfully reproduces the results obtained via the ic-MRCCSD scheme truncated to two commutators. A formal proof is given of the equivalence of the ic-MRCC and sqic-MRCC methods with the internally contracted and full configuration interaction approaches.},

Lett. 428 (2006) 461(20 September)] is reformulated and applied to multi-reference cases with complete active space (CAS) reference wave functions. The generalised van Vleck perturbation theory is employed to set up the perturbation equations. It is demonstrated that this leads to a consistent and well defined theory which fulfils all important criteria of a generally applicable ab initio method: The theory is proven numerically and analytically to be size-consistent and invariant with respect to unitary orbital transformations within the inactive, active and virtual orbital spaces. In contrast to most previously proposed multi-reference perturbation theories the necessary condition for a proper perturbation theory to fulfil the zeroth order perturbation equation is exactly satisfied with the RE partitioning itself without additional projectors on configurational spaces. The theory is applied to several excited states of the benchmark systems CH2, SiH2, and NH2, as well as to the lowest states of the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms. In all cases comparisons are made with full configuration interaction results. The multi-reference (MR)-RE method is shown to provide very rapidly converging perturbation series. Energy differences between states of similar configurations converge even faster.},

In the first method, the unperturbed Hamiltonian is that part of the second quantization Hamiltonian that retains the number of electrons in the occupied orbital space. In the second method the electron-repulsion integrals (ERIs) with four non-occupied orbitals are substituted by ERIs with four occupied orbitals. Both approaches are size consistent and invariant with respect to unitary orbital transformations. Comparison of electronic energies with full CI, coupled-cluster, and M{\o}ller–Plesset results demonstrate that the new approaches are more accurate than M{\o}ller–Plesset perturbation theory and comparable with coupled-cluster results.},

abstract = {A multi-reference CI scheme is proposed which is aiming at a considerable reduction of the generally very large number of configurations of CI expansions in multi-configuration reference cases. This reduction is achieved by combining the idea of internal contraction, the concept of pair natural orbitals (PNO's) and CEPA (coupled electron pair) type approximations for the contributions of higher than double excitations. This latter estimate leads to size consistent results and also permits to employ reference wavefunctions that contain only the dominantly occupied configurations of the considered system. Applications to two test cases, the lowest states (3P,1D and1S) of the carbon atom and the symmetry forbiddenC2v insertion reaction of Be and H2, show that our method is able to truncate CI expansions to lengths of no more than 103--104 without losing more than 1--2{\{}{\%}{\}} of the correlation energy. The calculated excitation energies and energy barriers agree with the full CI results in the respective basis within about 1 kcal/mol. Thus the MC-CEPA-PNO method presents a very efficient way to obtain ``chemical accuracy'' in CI-calculations for molecular systems.},

@article{Guo2016a,
abstract = {Multi-reference (MR) electronic structure methods, such as MR configuration interaction or MR perturbation theory, can provide reliable energies and properties for many molecular phenomena like bond breaking, excited states, transition states or magnetic properties of transition metal complexes and clusters. However, owing to their inherent complexity, most MR methods are still too computationally expensive for large systems. Therefore the development of more computationally attractive MR approaches is necessary to enable routine application for large-scale chemical systems. Among the state-of-the-art MR methods, second-order N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2) is an efficient, size-consistent, and intruder-state-free method. However, there are still two important bottlenecks in practical applications of NEVPT2 to large systems: (a) the high computational cost of NEVPT2 for large molecules, even with moderate active spaces and (b) the prohibitive cost for treating large active spaces. In this work, we address problem (a) by developing a linear scaling "partially contracted" NEVPT2 method. This development uses the idea of domain-based local pair natural orbitals (DLPNOs) to form a highly efficient algorithm. As shown previously in the framework of single-reference methods, the DLPNO concept leads to an enormous reduction in computational effort while at the same time providing high accuracy (approaching 99.9{\%} of the correlation energy), robustness, and black-box character. In the DLPNO approach, the virtual space is spanned by pair natural orbitals that are expanded in terms of projected atomic orbitals in large orbital domains, while the inactive space is spanned by localized orbitals. The active orbitals are left untouched. Our implementation features a highly efficient "electron pair prescreening" that skips the negligible inactive pairs. The surviving pairs are treated using the partially contracted NEVPT2 formalism. A detailed comparison between the partial and strong contraction schemes is made, with conclusions that discourage the strong contraction scheme as a basis for local correlation methods due to its non-invariance with respect to rotations in the inactive and external subspaces. A minimal set of conservatively chosen truncation thresholds controls the accuracy of the method. With the default thresholds, about 99.9{\%} of the canonical partially contracted NEVPT2 correlation energy is recovered while the crossover of the computational cost with the already very efficient canonical method occurs reasonably early; in linear chain type compounds at a chain length of around 80 atoms. Calculations are reported for systems with more than 300 atoms and 5400 basis functions.},

abstract = {The internally contracted multireference coupled cluster (icMRCC) method allows a highly accurate description of both static and dynamic correlation with a computational scaling similar to single reference coupled cluster theory. The authors show that the method can lose its orbital invariance and size consistency when no special care is taken in the elimination of redundant excitations. Using the BeH(2) model system, four schemes are compared which differ in their treatment of linear dependencies between excitations of different rank (such as between singles and doubles). While the energy curves agree within tens of $\mu$E(h) when truncating the cluster operator at double excitations (icMRCCSD), inclusion of triple excitations (icMRCCSDT) leads to significant differences of more than 1 mE(h). One scheme clearly yields the best results, while the others even turn out to be not size consistent. The former procedure uses genuine single and double excitations and discards those linear combinations of (spectator) double and triple excitations which have the same effect on the reference function. With this approach, the equilibrium structure and harmonic vibrational frequencies of ozone obtained with icMRCCSDT are in excellent agreement with CCSDTQ. The authors further apply icMRCC methods to potential energy surfaces of HF, LiF, N(2), and to the singlet-triplet splitting of benzynes. In particular, the latter calculations have been made possible by implementing the method with the proper formal scaling using automated techniques.},

@article{Hanauer2012,
abstract = {Within the framework of a generalized normal ordering (GNO), invented by Mukherjee [1], the reduced density matrix cumulants of the (multiconfigurational) reference wave function play a central role, as they arise directly from the contraction rules. The extended Wick theorem allows contractions of an arbitrary number of active annihilators and creators through a cumulant of corresponding rank. Because the cumulant rank truncates naturally only at the number of active spin orbitals, practical applications of the GNO concept seem to rely on a fast convergence of the cumulant series, allowing one to neglect cumulants with high rank. By computing cumulant norms for selected systems (and up to rank 16), we demonstrate that the cumulants decay approximately exponentially with increasing rank for single reference cases, while the convergence is generally slower for multireference cases. When strong left–right correlation is present as in the singlet state of a dissociated N2 molecule, even the cumulant with maximum rank, $\lambda$12≈−1.5 for a CAS(6,6), is not negligible per se. Besides reporting numerical results, the authors reformulate the theory of reduced density matrices and their cumulants using a notation that is particularly easy to handle, highlighting the close connection to conventional statistics. From this statistical approach, a simple interpretation of reduced density matrices and cumulants follows, according to which an n-body cumulant is a measure for the correlation between the occupation numbers of n spin orbitals. This interpretation is also valid for cumulants with ranks exceeding the number of electrons in the system.},

The latter variationally optimizes a class of ansatz states known as matrix product states, where operators are correspondingly represented as matrix product operators (MPOs). The MPO construction scheme presented here eliminates the previous performance disadvantages while retaining the additional flexibility provided by a matrix product approach, for example, the specification of expectation values becomes an input parameter. In this way, MPOs for different symmetries - abelian and non-abelian - and different relativistic and non-relativistic models may be solved by an otherwise unmodified program.},

Phys. 127, 221106 (2007)] are explained in more detail and extended to open-shell systems. Extensive benchmark calculations are presented, which demonstrate great improvements in basis set convergence for a wide variety of applications. These include reaction energies of both open- and closed-shell reactions, atomization energies, electron affinities, ionization potentials, equilibrium geometries, and harmonic vibrational frequencies. For all these quantities, results better than the AV5Z quality are obtained already with AVTZ basis sets, and usually AVDZ treatments reach at least the conventional AVQZ quality. For larger molecules, the additional cost for these improvements is only a few percent of the time for a standard CCSD(T) calculation. For the first time ever, total reaction energies with chemical accuracy are obtained using valence-double-zeta basis sets.},

Instead of using configuration state functions as adopted by Siegbahn, we propose that Slater determinants should be used. The approach then needs no formula tape, the one-electron coupling coefficients being easily generated as required. The method is totally vectorised, and applies as programmed to the lowest eigenvalue of any spin and space symmetry. The timings for Siegbahn's examples are appropoximately halved using this procedure, and in a full CI calculation involving 107942 configurations, 18 CRAY-1S CPU seconds were required per iteration.},

abstract = {We present a second-order perturbation theory based on a density matrix renormalization group self-consistent field (DMRG-SCF) reference function. The method reproduces the solution of the complete active space with second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) when the DMRG reference function is represented by a sufficiently large number of renormalized many-body basis, thereby being named DMRG-CASPT2 method. The DMRG-SCF is able to describe non-dynamical correlation with large active space that is insurmountable to the conventional CASSCF method, while the second-order perturbation theory provides an efficient description of dynamical correlation effects. The capability of our implementation is demonstrated for an application to the potential energy curve of the chromium dimer, which is one of the most demanding multireference systems that require best electronic structure treatment for non-dynamical and dynamical correlation as well as large basis sets. The DMRG-CASPT2/cc-pwCV5Z calculations were performed with a large (3d double-shell) active space consisting of 28 orbitals. Our approach using large-size DMRG reference addressed the problems of why the dissociation energy is largely overestimated by CASPT2 with the small active space consisting of 12 orbitals (3d4s), and also is oversensitive to the choice of the zeroth-order Hamiltonian.},

@article{Mahapatra1998,
abstract = {The traditional multi-reference coupled cluster (MRCC) methods are based on effective hamiltonian formalism and often suffer from the problem of intruders. A state-specific MRCC approach, focusing on only one state, offers the attractive possibility of avoiding intruders while at the same time incorporating the nondynamical correlation in a size-extensive manner. In this paper we discuss two alternative paradigms which allow us to achieve this goal. The first, to be called the decontracted description, we deliberately retain certain linearly dependent cluster amplitudes and allow the combining coefficients of the reference determinants to be updated to their values for the exact function. The presence of the linearly dependent cluster amplitudes requires imposition of suitable sufficiency conditions, which are invoked in a manner which naturally ensures size-extensivity. In the second approach, to be called the contracted description, we would generate a cluster expansion with respect to the entire reference function consisting of a combination of reference determinants and retain only the linearly independent cluster-amplitudes in the cluster expansion. For an efficient implementation of the formalism, we shall introduce the notion of extended normal ordering and an analogue of Wick's theorem which uses the entire reference function as the multi-determinantal analogue of the vacuum. This necessarily imposes the restriction that the combining coefficients appearing in the reference function have to remain frozen in the equations for the cluster amplitudes. Relaxation of the coefficients can be acheived only after the cluster-amplitudes with the current coefficients are solved.},

More than 100 theoretical investigations of the beryllium dimer have been published, reporting a wide range of bond lengths and dissociation energies. In contrast, there have been only a handful of experimental studies that provide data against which these models could be tested. Ultimately, the uncertain extrapolation behavior associated with the available data has prevented quantitative comparisons with theory. In our experiment, we resolve this issue by recording and analyzing spectra that sample all the bound vibrational levels of the beryllium dimer molecule's electronic ground state. After more than 70 years of research on this problem, the experimental data and theoretical models for the dimer are finally reconciled.},

abstract = {The quasi-degenerate perturbation theory (QDPT) with complete active space (CAS) self-consistent field (SCF) reference functions is extended to the general multiconfiguration (MC) SCF references functions case. A computational scheme that utilizes both diagrammatic and sum-over-states approaches is presented. The second-order effective Hamiltonian is computed for the external intermediate configurations (including virtual or/and core orbitals) by the diagrammatic approach and for internal intermediate configurations (including only active orbitals) by the configuration interaction matrix-based sum-over-states approach. The method is tested on the calculations of excitation energies of H2O, potential energy curves of LiF, and valence excitation energies of H2CO. The results show that the present method yields very close results to the corresponding CAS-SCF reference QDPT results and the available experimental values. The deviations from CAS-SCF reference QDPT values are less than 0.1 eV on the average for the excitation energies of H2O and less than 1 kcal/mol for the potential energy curves of LiF. In the calculation of the valence excited energies of H2CO, the maximum deviation from available experimental values is 0.28 eV. {\textcopyright} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {We investigate tree tensor network states for quantum chemistry. Tree tensor network states represent one of the simplest generalizations of matrix product states and the density matrix renormalization group. While matrix product states encode a one-dimensional entanglement structure, tree tensor network states encode a tree entanglement structure, allowing for a more flexible description of general molecules. We describe an optimal tree tensor network state algorithm for quantum chemistry. We introduce the concept of half-renormalization which greatly improves the efficiency of the calculations. Using our efficient formulation we demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of tree tensor network states versus matrix product states. We carry out benchmark calculations both on tree systems (hydrogen trees and $\pi$-conjugated dendrimers) as well as non-tree molecules (hydrogen chains, nitrogen dimer, and chromium dimer). In general, tree tensor network states require much fewer renormalized states to achieve the same accuracy as matrix product states. In non-tree molecules, whether this translates into a computational savings is system dependent, due to the higher prefactor and computational scaling associated with tree algorithms. In tree like molecules, tree network states are easily superior to matrix product states. As an illustration, our largest dendrimer calculation with tree tensor network states correlates 110 electrons in 110 active orbitals.},

abstract = {Linear response theory for the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG-LRT) was first presented in terms of the DMRG renormalization projectors [J. J. Dorando, J. Hachmann, and G. K.-L. Chan, J. Chem. Phys. 130, 184111 (2009)]. Later, with an understanding of the manifold structure of the matrix product state (MPS) ansatz, which lies at the basis of the DMRG algorithm, a way was found to construct the linear response space for general choices of the MPS gauge in terms of the tangent space vectors [J. Haegeman, J. I. Cirac, T. J. Osborne, I. Pižorn, H. Verschelde, and F. Verstraete, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 070601 (2011)]. These two developments led to the formulation of the Tamm-Dancoff and random phase approximations (TDA and RPA) for MPS. This work describes how these LRTs may be efficiently implemented through minor modifications of the DMRG sweep algorithm, at a computational cost which scales the same as the ground-state DMRG algorithm. In fact, the mixed canonical MPS form implicit to the DMRG sweep is essential for efficient implementation of the RPA, due to the structure of the second-order tangent space. We present ab initio DMRG-TDA results for excited states of polyenes, the water molecule, and a [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster.},

The algorithm can be used together with either single- or multireference CI wave functions but assumes a spatially nondegenerate ground state. A one-electron approximation to the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) operator is used. Presently the implementation uses the INDO/S model of Zerner and coworkers. Results are presented for a representative collection of Cu(II) complexes with N-, O-, and S-containing ligands. The calculations reproduce the trends in the experimental data well and show no systematic errors. For the test set the g values are reproduced with a standard deviation of 0.021. The method has therefore a good cost–performance ratio and is expected to be helpful in chemical and biochemical applications. Further improvements are feasible and necessary and are briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2001 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc. Int J Quant Chem 83: 104–114, 2001},

Upon variational energy minimization, the network creates particle number projections that remove the charge fluctuations responsible for size inconsistency.

Here we expand our previous theory by investigating (i) a commutator approximation that is applied at quadratic, as opposed to linear, order in the effective Hamiltonian, and (ii) incorporation of the three-body reduced density matrix in the operator and density matrix decompositions. The quadratic commutator approximation improves CT's accuracy when used with a single-determinant reference, repairing the previous formal disadvantage of the single-reference linear CT theory relative to singles and doubles coupled cluster theory. Calculations on the BH and HF binding curves confirm this improvement. In multireference systems, the three-body reduced density matrix increases the overall accuracy of the CT theory. Tests on the H(2)O and N(2) binding curves yield results highly competitive with expensive state-of-the-art multireference methods, such as the multireference Davidson-corrected configuration interaction (MRCI+Q), averaged coupled pair functional, and averaged quadratic coupled cluster theories.},

abstract = {Second order R12 theory is presented and derived alternatively using the second quantized hole-particle formalism. We have shown that in order to ensure the strong orthogonality between the R12 and the conventional part of the wave function, the explicit use of projection operators can be easily avoided by an appropriate partitioning of the involved operators to parts which are fully describable within the computational orbital basis and complementary parts that involve imaginary orbitals from the complete orbital basis. Various Hamiltonian splittings are discussed and computationally investigated for a set of nine molecules and their atomization energies. If no generalized Brillouin condition is assumed, with all relevant partitionings the one-particle contribution arising in the explicitly correlated part of the first order wave function has to be considered and has a significant role when smaller atomic orbital basis sets are used. The most appropriate Hamiltonian splitting results if one follows the conventional perturbation theory for a general non-Hartree-Fock reference. Then, no couplings between the R12 part and the conventional part arise within the first order wave function. The computationally most favorable splitting when the whole complementary part of the Hamiltonian is treated as a perturbation fails badly. These conclusions also apply to MP2-F12 approaches with different correlation factors.},

The CCGF method is applied to the calculation of vertical ionization potentials (IPs) of a number of small molecules, notably, HF, N2, CO, F2, CS, C2H4, H2O, and H2CO. The results for the outer-valence IPs, with an average error of 0.12 eV, compare favorably to third-order equation-of-motion calculations within the same basis set (average error 0.28 eV) and outer-valence GF (OVGF) values taken from the literature (average error 0.17 eV). Ground-state properties that derive from the CCGF are compared to expectation values obtained in the related normal coupled cluster methods (NCCM) approximation from a formal point of view. Correlation energies obtained in CCGF are compared to CCSD results for the above series of molecules and, in addition, the so-called true correlation energy density as obtained from the CCGF is compared to the result from an accurate MR–CI calculation for a highly correlated system: the HF molecule at large internuclear separation. {\textcopyright} 1993 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = { Interaction energies of dimers containing alkaline earth (Be, Mg, and Ca) metals have been investigated using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) and supermolecular (SM) methods. Also, to enable broader comparisons, some calculations have been performed on the Zn dimer and on the He−Mg dimer. Although all of the investigated metallic atoms have closed electronic shells, the quasidegeneracy of the ground states of these atoms with the lowest-lying excited states leads to convergence problems in theories based on a single-determinant reference state. The main goal of the present work was to establish how the quality of the interaction energies computed using various electronic-structure methods changes across the range of atoms. We show that although the convergence problems become somewhat less severe with the increase of the atomic number, single-determinant-based methods do not provide reliable interaction energies for any of the investigated metallic dimers even at the level of the coupled-cluster method with single, double, and noniterative triple excitations [CCSD(T)]. However, interaction energies accurate to within a few percent can be obtained if CCSD(T) calculations in large basis sets are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit and followed by full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations with a frozen-core (FC) approximation. Since the systems considered contain only two valence electrons, FCI/FC calculations have been feasible for all of them except for Zn2, providing the best theoretical estimates of the binding energies to date. We found that a large part of the error of the SAPT results originates from limiting some exchange components to terms proportional to the squares of the intermonomer orbital overlap integrals. When the neglected terms were approximately accounted for, the accuracy improved significantly and became comparable to that of CCSD(T), allowing us to obtain for the first time a physical interpretation of the interaction energies in metallic dimers. },

Recent spectroscopic measurements characterized the molecule's ground electronic state with sufficient resolution to distinguish 11 vibrational levels; the possibility that a twelfth level lay just below the dissociation threshold remained unresolved. Here we present a potential function, based on ab initio calculations at the full configuration interaction level, that definitively supports the presence of this twelfth vibrational state. “Morphed” versions of this potential, fitted to experimental data, closely reproduce the observed spectra to within 0.1 cm−1, bolstering the strength of the assignment.},

Its complicated nature of binding, with a formal sextuple bond and an unusual potential energy curve (PEC), is emblematic of the competing tendencies and delicate balance found in many strongly correlated materials. We present an accurate calculation of the PEC and ground state properties of Cr2, using the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method. Unconstrained, exact AFQMC calculations are first carried out for a medium-sized but realistic basis set. Elimination of the remaining finite-basis errors and extrapolation to the complete basis set limit are then achieved with a combination of phaseless and exact AFQMC calculations. Final results for the PEC and spectroscopic constants are in excellent agreement with experiment.},

abstract = {Exact decoupling of positive- and negative-energy states in relativistic quantum chemistry is discussed in the framework of unitary transformation techniques. The obscure situation that each scheme of decoupling transformations relies on different, but very special parametrizations of the employed unitary matrices is critically analyzed. By applying the most general power series ansatz for the parametrization of the unitary matrices it is shown that all transformation protocols for decoupling the Dirac Hamiltonian have necessarily to start with an initial free-particle Foldy-Wouthuysen step. The purely numerical iteration scheme applying X-operator techniques to the Barysz-Sadlej-Snijders (BSS) Hamiltonian is compared to the analytical schemes of the Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) and Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH) approaches. Relying on an illegal 1/c expansion of the Dirac Hamiltonian around the nonrelativistic limit, any higher-order FW transformation is in principle ill defined and doomed to fail, irrespective of the specific features of the external potential. It is shown that the DKH method is the only valid analytic unitary transformation scheme for the Dirac Hamiltonian. Its exact infinite-order version can be realized purely numerically by the BSS scheme, which is only able to yield matrix representations of the decoupled Hamiltonian but no analytic expressions for this operator. It is explained why a straightforward numerical iterative extension of the DKH procedure to arbitrary order employing matrix representations is not feasible within standard one-component electronic structure programs. A more sophisticated ansatz based on a symbolical evaluation of the DKH operators via a suitable parser routine is needed instead and introduced in Part II of this work.},

@article{Riplinger2013,
abstract = {In previous publications, it was shown that an efficient local coupled cluster method with single- and double excitations can be based on the concept of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) [F. Neese, A. Hansen, and D. G. Liakos, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 064103 (2009)]. The resulting local pair natural orbital-coupled-cluster single double (LPNO-CCSD) method has since been proven to be highly reliable and efficient. For large molecules, the number of amplitudes to be determined is reduced by a factor of 10(5)-10(6) relative to a canonical CCSD calculation on the same system with the same basis set. In the original method, the PNOs were expanded in the set of canonical virtual orbitals and single excitations were not truncated. This led to a number of fifth order scaling steps that eventually rendered the method computationally expensive for large molecules (e.g., {\textgreater}100 atoms). In the present work, these limitations are overcome by a complete redesign of the LPNO-CCSD method. The new method is based on the combination of the concepts of PNOs and projected atomic orbitals (PAOs). Thus, each PNO is expanded in a set of PAOs that in turn belong to a given electron pair specific domain. In this way, it is possible to fully exploit locality while maintaining the extremely high compactness of the original LPNO-CCSD wavefunction. No terms are dropped from the CCSD equations and domains are chosen conservatively. The correlation energy loss due to the domains remains below {\textless}0.05{\%}, which implies typically 15-20 but occasionally up to 30 atoms per domain on average. The new method has been given the acronym DLPNO-CCSD ("domain based LPNO-CCSD"). The method is nearly linear scaling with respect to system size. The original LPNO-CCSD method had three adjustable truncation thresholds that were chosen conservatively and do not need to be changed for actual applications. In the present treatment, no additional truncation parameters have been introduced. Any additional truncation is performed on the basis of the three original thresholds. There are no real-space cutoffs. Single excitations are truncated using singles-specific natural orbitals. Pairs are prescreened according to a multipole expansion of a pair correlation energy estimate based on local orbital specific virtual orbitals (LOSVs). Like its LPNO-CCSD predecessor, the method is completely of black box character and does not require any user adjustments. It is shown here that DLPNO-CCSD is as accurate as LPNO-CCSD while leading to computational savings exceeding one order of magnitude for larger systems. The largest calculations reported here featured {\textgreater}8800 basis functions and {\textgreater}450 atoms. In all larger test calculations done so far, the LPNO-CCSD step took less time than the preceding Hartree-Fock calculation, provided no approximations have been introduced in the latter. Thus, based on the present development reliable CCSD calculations on large molecules with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy are realized.},

Compared to a straightforward implementation of SC-NEVPT2 with DMRG wavefunctions, the computational scaling and storage requirements are reduced. This favorable scaling opens up the possibility of calculations with larger active spaces. A specially designed renormalization scheme ensures that both the electronic ground state and the perturber functions are well represented in the renormalized Hilbert space.

Basis set and relativistic effects have also been considered. For the geometry considered, our best results indicate the ground spin state to be a closed-shell singlet, followed by a pair of low-lying triplet states, with additional singlet states and the lowest quintet state lying significantly higher in energy. Hartree-Fock and density functional theory (DFT) results are obtained and are compared to the more robust CASSCF results. The Hartree-Fock results are qualitatively incorrect for the relative energies of the states considered. Popular density functionals such as BP86 and B3LYP are superior to Hartree-Fock for this problem, but they give inconsistent answers regarding the ordering of the lowest singlet and triplet states and they greatly underestimate the singlet-quintet gap. We obtained multiple Hartree-Fock and DFT solutions within a given spin multiplicity, and these solutions have been subjected to wave function stability analysis.},

Phys. 136, 124121 (2012)], which described a spin-adapted (SU(2) symmetry) density matrix renormalization group algorithm, to additionally utilize general non-Abelian point group symmetries. A key strength of the present formulation is that the requisite tensor operators are not hard-coded for each symmetry group, but are instead generated on the fly using the appropriate Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. This allows our single implementation to easily enable (or disable) any non-Abelian point group symmetry (including SU(2) spin symmetry). We use our implementation to compute the ground state potential energy curve of the C2 dimer in the cc-pVQZ basis set (with a frozen-core), corresponding to a Hilbert space dimension of 10(12) many-body states. While our calculated energy lies within the 0.3 mEh error bound of previous initiator full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo and correlation energy extrapolation by intrinsic scaling calculations, our estimated residual error is only 0.01 mEh, much more accurate than these previous estimates. Due to the additional efficiency afforded by the algorithm, the excitation energies (Te) of eight lowest lying excited states: a(3)$\Pi$u, b(3)$\Sigma$g (-), A(1)$\Pi$u, c(3)$\Sigma$u (+), B(1)$\Delta$g, B(') (1)$\Sigma$g (+), d(3)$\Pi$g, and C(1)$\Pi$g are calculated, which agree with experimentally derived values to better than 0.06 eV. In addition, we also compute the potential energy curves of twelve states: the three lowest levels for each of the irreducible representations (1)$\Sigma$g (+), (1)$\Sigma$u (+), (1)$\Sigma$g (-), and (1)$\Sigma$u (-), to an estimated accuracy of 0.1 mEh of the exact result in this basis.},

The MPS-LCC theory shows a speed up of several orders of magnitude over the usual Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm while delivering energies in excellent agreement with converged DMRG calculations. Also, in all the benchmark calculations presented here, MPS-LCC outperformed the commonly used multi-reference quantum chemistry methods in some cases giving energies in excess of an order of magnitude more accurate.

abstract = {We extend the spin-adapted density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm of McCulloch and Gulacsi [Europhys. Lett. 57, 852 (2002)]10.1209/epl/i2002-00393-0 to quantum chemical Hamiltonians. This involves using a quasi-density matrix, to ensure that the renormalized DMRG states are eigenfunctions of 2, and the Wigner-Eckart theorem, to reduce overall storage and computational costs. We argue that the spin-adapted DMRG algorithm is most advantageous for low spin states. Consequently, we also implement a singlet-embedding strategy due to Tatsuaki [Phys. Rev. E 61, 3199 (2000)]10.1103/PhysRevE.61.3199 where we target high spin states as a component of a larger fictitious singlet system. Finally, we present an efficient algorithm to calculate one- and two-body reduced density matrices from the spin-adapted wavefunctions. We evaluate our developments with benchmark calculations on transition metal system active space models. These include the Fe2S2, [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]2−, and Cr2 systems. In the case of Fe2S2, the spin-ladder spacing is on the microHartree scale, and here we show that we can target such very closely spaced states. In [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]2−, we calculate particle and spin correlation functions, to examine the role of sulfur bridging orbitals in the electronic structure. In Cr2 we demonstrate that spin-adaptation with the Wigner-Eckart theorem and using singlet embedding can yield up to an order of magnitude increase in computational efficiency. Overall, these calculations demonstrate the potential of using spin-adaptation to extend the range of DMRG calculations in complex transition metal problems.},

abstract = {We describe a formulation of multi-reference perturbation theory that obtains a rigorous upper bound to the second order energy by minimizing the Hylleraas functional in the space of matrix product states (MPS). The first order wavefunctions so obtained can also be used to compute the third order energy with little overhead. Our formulation has several advantages including (i) flexibility with respect to the choice of zeroth order Hamiltonian, (ii) recovery of the exact uncontracted multi-reference perturbation theory energies in the limit of large MPS bond dimension, (iii) no requirement to compute high body density matrices, (iv) an embarrassingly parallel algorithm (scaling up to the number of virtual orbitals, squared, processors). Preliminary numerical examples show that the MPS bond dimension required for accurate first order wavefunctions scales sub-linearly with the size of the basis.},

abstract = {In this work, we generalize the recently proposed matrix product state perturbation theory (MPSPT) for calculating energies of excited states using quasi-degenerate (QD) perturbation theory. Our formulation uses the Kirtman-Certain-Hirschfelder canonical Van Vleck perturbation theory, which gives Hermitian effective Hamiltonians at each order, and also allows one to make use of Wigner's 2n + 1 rule. Further, our formulation satisfies Granovsky's requirement of model space invariance which is important for obtaining smooth potential energy curves. Thus, when we use MPSPT with the Dyall Hamiltonian, we obtain a model space invariant version of quasi-degenerate n-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT), a property that the usual formulation of QD-NEVPT2 based on a multipartitioning technique lacked. We use our method on the benchmark problems of bond breaking of LiF which shows ionic to covalent curve crossing and the twist around the double bond of ethylene where significant valence-Rydberg mixing occurs in the excited states. In accordance with our previous work, we find that multi-reference linearized coupled cluster theory is more accurate than other multi-reference theories of similar cost.},

They carry out electron transfer, redox chemistry and even oxygen sensing, in diverse processes including nitrogen fixation, respiration and photosynthesis. Their low-lying electronic states are key to their remarkable reactivity, but they cannot be directly observed. Here, we present the first ever quantum calculation of the electronic levels of {\{}{\$}[{\$}{\}}2Fe–2S{\{}{\$}]{\$}{\}} and {\{}{\$}[{\$}{\}}4Fe–4S{\{}{\$}]{\$}{\}} clusters free from any model assumptions. Our results highlight the limitations of long-standing models of their electronic structure. In particular, we demonstrate that the widely used Heisenberg double exchange model underestimates the number of states by one to two orders of magnitude, which can conclusively be traced to the absence of Fe dnchem.2041-m5gif110136d excitations, thought to be important in these clusters. Furthermore, the electronic energy levels of even the same spin are dense on the scale of vibrational fluctuations and this provides a natural explanation for the ubiquity of these clusters in catalysis in nature.},

abstract = {One of the key challenges of quantum-chemical multi-configuration methods is the necessity to manually select orbitals for the active space. This selection requires both expertise and experience and can therefore impose severe limitations on the applicability of this most general class of ab initio methods. A poor choice of the active orbital space may yield even qualitatively wrong results. This is obviously a severe problem, especially for wave function methods that are designed to be systematically improvable. Here, we show how the iterative nature of the density matrix renormalization group combined with its capability to include up to about 100 orbitals in the active space can be exploited for a systematic assessment and selection of active orbitals. These benefits allow us to implement an automated approach for active orbital space selection, which can turn multi-configuration models into black box approaches.},

@article{Werner2006,
abstract = {Three major obstacles in electronic structure theory are the steep scalings of computer time with respect to system size and basis size and the slow convergence of correlation energies in orbital basis sets. Three solutions to these are, respectively, local methods, density fitting, and explicit correlation; in this work, we combine all three to produce a low-order scaling method that can achieve accurate MP2 energies for large systems. The errors introduced by the local approximations into the R12 treatment are analyzed for 16 chemical reactions involving 21 molecules. Weak pair approximations, as well as local resolution of the identity approximations, are tested for molecules with up to 49 atoms, over 100 correlated electrons, and over 1000 basis functions.},

Commun. 185, 1501 (2014)], to study the lowest singlet, triplet, and quintet states of the oxo-Mn(Salen) complex. We describe how an initial approximate DMRG calculation in a large active space around the Fermi level can be used to obtain a good set of starting orbitals for subsequent complete-active-space or DMRG self-consistent field calculations. This procedure mitigates the need for a localization procedure, followed by a manual selection of the active space. Per multiplicity, the same active space of 28 electrons in 22 orbitals (28e, 22o) is obtained with the 6-31G(*), cc-pVDZ, and ANO-RCC-VDZP basis sets (the latter with DKH2 scalar relativistic corrections). Our calculations provide new insight into the electronic structure of the quintet.},

abstract = {An effective Hamiltonian perturbed with explicit interelectronic correlation is derived from similarity transformation of Hamiltonian using a unitary operator with Slater-type geminals. The Slater-type geminal is projected onto the excitation (and deexcitation) component as in the F12 theory. Simplification is made by truncating higher-body operators, resulting in a correlated Hamiltonian which is Hermitian and has exactly the same complexity as the original Hamiltonian in the second quantized form. It can thus be easily combined with arbitrary correlation models proposed to date. The present approach constructs a singularity-free Hamiltonian a priori, similarly to the so-called transcorrelated theory, while the use of the canonical transformation assures that the effective Hamiltonian is two-body and Hermite. Our theory is naturally extensible to multireference calculations on the basis of the generalized normal ordering. The construction of the effective Hamiltonian is non-iterative. The numerical assessments demonstrate that the present scheme improves the basis set convergence of the post-mean-field calculations at a similar rate to the explicitly correlated methods proposed by others that couple geminals and conventional excitations.},

Our test cases show that while the cumulant approximated forms are degraded in accuracy relative to the parent theory and exhibit intruder state problems that must be carefully handled, they may provide a route to a simple estimation of dynamic correlation when the parent perturbation theory is infeasible. Nonetheless, further work is clearly needed on better approximations to the denominators in the perturbation theory.},

abstract = {We present a spin-adapted density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm designed to target spin and spatial symmetry states that can be difficult to obtain while using a non-spin-adapted algorithm. The algorithmic modifications that have to be introduced into the usual density matrix renormalization group scheme in order to spin adapt it are discussed, and it is demonstrated that the introduced modifications do not change the overall scaling of the method. The new approach is tested on HNCO, a model system, that has a singlet-triplet curve crossing between states of the same symmetry. The advantages of the spin-adapted DMRG scheme are discussed, and it is concluded that the spin-adapted DMRG method converges better in almost all cases and gives more parallel curves to the full configuration interaction result than the non-spin-adapted method. It is shown that the spin-adapted DMRG energies can be lower than the ones obtained from the non-spin-adapted scheme. Such a counterintuitive result is explained by noting that the spin-adapted method is not a special case of the non-spin-adapted one; consequently, the spin-adapted result is not an upper bound for the non-spin-adapted energy.},

note = {The $N_v$ determinants in the variational space are connected to ${\cal O}(n^2v^2N_v)$ determinants in the perturbative space with non-zero Hamiltonian matrix elements,
where $n$ is the number of electrons and $v$ is the number of virtual orbitals.
For a relatively conservative number of $n=12$, $v=50$ and $N_v=10^7$, the perturbative space will contain over $10^{12}$ determinants, requiring over 10 terabyte memory.
The original HCI algorithm reduces this storage requirement by orders of magnitude by only requiring the storage of
determinants $D_a$ for which $\left|H_{ai}c_i\right|>\epsilon_2$ for
at least one determinant $D_i \in \mathcal{V}$.  Nevertheless, for many systems this is the most memory
intensive part of the original algorithm.}

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{Feb 27}},
Abstract = {{A combination of state-of-the-art theoretical methods has been used to
   obtain an atomic-level picture of classical and quantum ordering of
   protons in cold high-pressure solid hydrogen. We focus mostly on phases
   II and III of hydrogen, exploring the effects of quantum nuclear motion
   on certain features of these phases (through a number of ab initio path
   integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations at particular points on
   the phase diagram). We also examine the importance of van der Waals
   forces in this system by performing calculations using the optB88-vdW
   density functional, which accounts for non-local correlations. Our
   calculations reveal that the transition between phases I and II is
   strongly quantum in nature, resulting from a competition between
   anisotropic inter-molecular interactions that restrict molecular
   rotation and thermal plus quantum fluctuations of the nuclear positions
   that facilitate it. The transition from phase II to III is more
   classical because quantum nuclear motion plays only a secondary role and
   the transition is determined primarily by the underlying potential
   energy surface. A structure of P2(1)/c symmetry with 24 atoms in the
   primitive unit cell is found to be stable when anharmonic quantum
   nuclear vibrational motion is included at finite temperatures using the
   PIMD method. This structure gives a good account of the infra-red and
   Raman vibron frequencies of phase II. We find additional support for a
   C2/c structure as a strong candidate for phase III, since it remains
   transparent up to 300 GPa, even when quantum nuclear effects are
   included. Finally, we find that accounting for van der Waals forces
   improves the agreement between experiment and theory for the parts of
   the phase diagram considered, when compared to previous work which
   employed the widely-used Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation
   functional.}},

Abstract = {{We have used density-functional-theory (DFT) methods together with a
   structure searching algorithm to make an experimentally constrained
   prediction of the structure of ammonia dihydrate II (ADH-II). The DFT
   structure is in good agreement with neutron diffraction data and
   verifies the prediction. The structure consists of the same basic
   structural elements as ADH-I, with a modest alteration to the packing,
   but a considerable reduction in volume. The phase diagram of the known
   ADH and ammonia monohydrate + water-ice structures is calculated with
   the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof density functional, and the effects of a
   semi-empirical dispersion corrected functional are investigated. The
   results of our DFT calculations of the finite-pressure elastic constants
   of ADH-II are compared with the available experimental data for the
   elastic strain coefficients. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Following on from the success of the previous crystal structure
   prediction blind tests (CSP1999, CSP2001, CSP2004 and CSP2007), a fifth
   such collaborative project (CSP2010) was organized at the Cambridge
   Crystallographic Data Centre. A range of methodologies was used by the
   participating groups in order to evaluate the ability of the current
   computational methods to predict the crystal structures of the six
   organic molecules chosen as targets for this blind test. The first four
   targets, two rigid molecules, one semi-flexible molecule and a 1: 1
   salt, matched the criteria for the targets from CSP2007, while the last
   two targets belonged to two new challenging categories - a larger, much
   more flexible molecule and a hydrate with more than one polymorph. Each
   group submitted three predictions for each target it attempted. There
   was at least one successful prediction for each target, and two groups
   were able to successfully predict the structure of the large flexible
   molecule as their first place submission. The results show that while
   not as many groups successfully predicted the structures of the three
   smallest molecules as in CSP2007, there is now evidence that
   methodologies such as dispersion-corrected density functional theory
   (DFT-D) are able to reliably do so. The results also highlight the many
   challenges posed by more complex systems and show that there are still
   issues to be overcome.}},

Abstract = {{We have used density-functional-theory methods together with a structure

   The most favorable stoichiometries at Earth's inner-core pressures

   atoms. The most stable stoichiometries were found to be (Fe and C),
   Fe(3)C, Fe(7)C(3), and Fe(2)C. The latter has not to our knowledge been
   discussed previously in relation to the Earth's core. The
   stoichiometries Fe(4)C and Fe(5)C(2) were found to be close to stability

   Formation of Fe/C compounds is energetically more favorable at 350 GPa

Abstract = {{Noble metals adopt close-packed structures at ambient pressure and

   molecular hydrogen at pressures above 21.5 GPa. PtH transforms to a

   superconductor at these pressures with a critical temperature of about
   10-25 K. These findings help to shed light on recent observations of

   diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) methods. Slater-Jastrow-backflow
   trial wave functions give lower DMC energies than Slater-Jastrow ones,
   and backflow slightly favors the beta-tin phase with respect to the
   diamond phase. We have investigated the changes in the equation of state
   that result from the use of different pseudopotentials, the inclusion of
   either zero-point motion or finite-temperature vibrations, and the
   application of corrections for finite-size effects. Our tests indicate
   that the choice of pseudopotential can significantly affect the equation
   of state. Using a Dirac-Fock pseudopotential leads to an overestimation
   of the transition pressure but an empirical pseudopotential designed for
   use in correlated calculations gives a transition pressure in quite good
   agreement with experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Using density-functional theory we investigate the evolution of the

   We find that nonrigid-band effects due to the contribution of Fe d
   states to the density of states at the Fermi level are crucial to the
   evolution of the magnetic phase diagram. Furthermore, the influence of
   disorder is important to the development of ferromagnetism upon Nb
   doping. These findings give a framework in which to understand the
   evolution of the magnetic ground state in the temperature-doping phase
   diagram. We investigate the magnetic instabilities in NbFe2. We find
   that explicit calculation of the Lindhard function, chi(0)(q), indicates
   that the primary instability is to finite q antiferromagnetism driven by
   Fermi-surface nesting. Total-energy calculations indicate that q=0
   antiferromagnetism is the ground state. We discuss the influence of
   competing q=0 and finite q instabilities on the presence of the

Abstract = {{Silica (SiO(2)) is an abundant component of the Earth whose crystalline
   polymorphs play key roles in its structure and dynamics. First principle
   density functional theory (DFT) methods have often been used to
   accurately predict properties of silicates, but fundamental failures
   occur. Such failures occur even in silica, the simplest silicate, and
   understanding pure silica is a prerequisite to understanding the rocky
   part of the Earth. Here, we study silica with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC),
   which until now was not computationally possible for such complex
   materials, and find that QMC overcomes the failures of DFT. QMC is a
   benchmark method that does not rely on density functionals but rather
   explicitly treats the electrons and their interactions via a stochastic
   solution of Schrodinger's equation. Using ground-state QMC plus phonons
   within the quasiharmonic approximation of density functional
   perturbation theory, we obtain the thermal pressure and equations of
   state of silica phases up to Earth's core-mantle boundary. Our results
   provide the best constrained equations of state and phase boundaries
   available for silica. QMC indicates a transition to the dense
   alpha-PbO(2) structure above the core-insulating D `' layer, but the
   absence of a seismic signature suggests the transition does not
   contribute significantly to global seismic discontinuities in the lower
   mantle. However, the transition could still provide seismic signals from
   deeply subducted oceanic crust. We also find an accurate shear elastic
   constant for stishovite and its geophysically important softening with
   pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (VMC and DMC) calculations

   constructed more accurate trial wave functions and used a larger system
   size, we have studied the dependence of the energy on the particle
   density and well width, and we have achieved much smaller statistical
   error bars. The correct value of the universal ratio of the energy of
   the interacting to that of the noninteracting gas, xi , is still a
   matter of debate. We find DMC values of xi of 0.4244(1) with 66
   particles and 0.4339(1) with 128 particles. The spherically averaged
   pair-correlation functions, momentum densities, and one-body density
   matrices are very similar in VMC and DMC, which suggests that our

   differences between the VMC and DMC results for the two-body density
   matrices and condensate fractions, which indicates that these quantities

   molecules. Our value of the adiabatic positron affinity (PA) of LiH of
   1.010(3) eV is very close to the best theoretical value of 1.005 eV,
   obtained from variational calculations using explicitly correlated
   Gaussian basis sets {[}K. Strasburger, J. Chem. Phys. 114, 00615
   (2001)]. We have obtained a reliable estimate of 0.0378(48) eV for the
   PA of the HCN molecule, which is almost 20 times larger than that
   obtained at the Hartree-Fock level, and strongly supports the binding of
   a positron in the electrostatic field of the HCN molecule. Our results
   show the importance of correlation effects for describing weakly bound
   positronic molecular complexes. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

   is known to form hydrogen-bonded solids(2-6), but we predict that at
   higher pressures it will form ammonium amide ionic solids consisting of
   alternate layers of NH4+ and NH2-ions. These ionic phases are predicted
   to be stable over a wide range of pressures readily obtainable in
   laboratory experiments. The occurrence of ionic phases is rationalized
   in terms of the relative ease of forming ammonium and amide ions from
   ammonia molecules, and the volume reduction on doing so. We also predict
   that the ionic bonding cannot be sustained under extreme compression and
   that, at pressures beyond the reach of current static-loading

Month = {{May 15}},
Abstract = {{We calculate energies, oscillator strengths for radiative recombination,
   and two-particle wave functions for the ground-state exciton and around
   100 excited states in a T-shaped quantum wire. We include the
   single-particle potential and the Coulomb interaction between the
   electron and hole on an equal footing, and perform exact diagonalization
   of the two-particle problem within a finite-basis set. We calculate
   spectra for all of the experimentally studied cases of T-shaped wires
   including symmetric and asymmetric GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs and
   InyGa1-yAs/AlxGa1-xAs structures. We study in detail the shape of the
   wave functions to gain insight into the nature of the various states for
   selected symmetric and asymmetric wires in which laser emission has been
   experimentally observed. We also calculate the binding energy of the
   ground-state exciton and the confinement energy of the one-dimensional
   (1D) quantum-wire-exciton state with respect to the 2D quantum-well
   exciton for a wide range of structures, varying the well width and the
   Al molar fraction x. We find that the largest binding energy of any wire
   constructed to date is 16.5 meV. We also notice that in asymmetric
   structures, the confinement energy is enhanced with respect to the
   symmetric forms with comparable parameters but the binding energy of the
   exciton is then lower than in the symmetric structures. For
   GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs wires we obtain an upper limit for the binding energy of
   around 25 meV in a 10-Angstrom -wide GaAs/AlAs structure that suggests
   that other materials must be explored in order to achieve
   room-temperature applications. There are some indications that
   InyGa1-yAs/A(l)xGa(1-x)As might be a good candidate.}},

Abstract = {{The long-range electronic correlations in a uniform electron gas may be
   deduced from the random-phase approximation (RPA) of Bohm and Pines
   {[}Phys. Rev. 92, 609 (1953)]. Here we generalize the RPA to nonuniform
   systems and use it to derive many-electron Slater-Jastrow trial wave
   functions for quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The RPA theory fixes the
   long-range behavior of the inhomogeneous two-body terms in the Jastrow
   factor and provides an accurate analytic expression for the one-body
   terms. It also explains the success of Slater-Jastrow trial functions
   containing determinants of Hartree-Fock or density-functional orbitals,
   even though these theories do not include Jastrow factors. After
   adjusting the RPA Jastrow factor to incorporate the known short-range
   behavior, we test it using variational Monte Carlo simulations. In the
   small inhomogeneous electron gas system we consider, the analytic
   RPA-based Jastrow factor slightly outperforms the standard numerically
   optimized form. The inhomogeneous RPA theory therefore enables us to
   reduce or even avoid the costly numerical optimization process.}},

   calculating saddle-point structures using a simple `ridge-walking'

Abstract = {{Fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is a stochastic algorithm for
   finding the lowest energy many-fermion wave function with the same nodal
   surface as a chosen trial function. It has proved itself among the most
   accurate methods available for calculating many-electron,ground states,
   and is one of the few approaches that can be applied to systems large
   enough to act as realistic models of solids. In attempts to use
   fixed-node DMC for excited-state calculations, it has often been assumed
   that the DMC energy must be greater than or equal to the energy of the
   lowest exact eigenfunction with the same symmetry as the trial function.
   We show that this assumption is not justified unless the trial function
   transforms according to a one-dimensional irreducible representation of
   the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian. If the trial function transforms
   according to a multidimensional irreducible representation,
   corresponding to a degenerate energy level, the DMC energy may lie below
   the energy of the lowest eigenstate of that symmetry. Weaker variational
   bounds may then be obtained by choosing trial functions transforming
   according to one-dimensional irreducible representations of subgroups of

   provided by this approach will make it possible to carry out stringent
   tests of the effectiveness of exchange-correlation functionals and in
   the long term aid in the search for better functionals.

   includes the Cmcm phase, which is a distortion of the rocksalt

   stable high pressure phases of III-V compounds. Our work relates
   directly to recent experimental work on III-V compounds, which has
   indicated that the previously reported high-pressure phase diagrams of
   these compounds should be reconsidered. Our results support the
   existence of stable Cmcm phases in InP and InAs and a stable or nearly
   stable Cmcm phase in GaP. We find stable Imm2 phases in each of the
   compounds studied. We also find a small range of thermodynamic stability
   for sc16 GaP. The energy-volume curves and phase diagrams of InP and
   InAs, as well as those of GaP and GaAs, show remarkable similarities.
   Along with previous work, we now have enough theoretical results to

@misc{distance-to-node,
 note = {These are proportional to the distance to the node as one approaches the node.
The former has the advantage that the gradient and Laplacian can be computed easily.
These are required in the drift-diffusion-reweighting form of the projector but not in the projector we use,
though having the gradient is helpful for sampling our projector.
However, it has the disadvantage that for large systems a small eigenvalue of the Slater matrix can be masked
by several large eigenvalues.}
}
@misc{opposite-contribution,
 note = {In S-FCIQMC ``opposite contribution" and ``opposite sign" are synonymous because
 the electrons on a given state are always ordered the same way.  In the present algorithm
 this cannot be done because we employ whichever permutation minimizes the distance between walkers.}
}
@misc{true_and_fixed_proj_diff,
 note = {It is easy to see that for small $\tau$ the true projector and the fixed-node projector are very different.
For example, for the $1^3$S state of the helium atom, the true projector has a nodal surface
$(\rvec_1'-\rvec_1)^2+(\rvec_2'-\rvec_2)^2=(\rvec_1'-\rvec_2)^2+(\rvec_2'-\rvec_1)^2$, i.e., $(\rvec_1'-\rvec_2')\cdot(\rvec_1-\rvec_2)=0$,
whereas the fixed-node projector has a nodal surface $r'_1=r'_2$.

@misc{PsiG_ne_PsiT,
 note = {Note that unlike the usual FN method, which uses $\PsiG=\PsiT$, we consider the more general
      FN method discussed in the Appendix, wherein $\PsiG$ need not be $\PsiT$ and the projected state has
      the nodes of $\PsiT$.

It supports calculations of metallic and insulating solids, molecules, atoms, and some model Hamiltonians. Implemented real space quantum Monte Carlo algorithms include variational, diffusion, and reptation Monte Carlo. QMCPACK uses Slater–Jastrow type trial wavefunctions in conjunction with a sophisticated optimizer capable of optimizing tens of thousands of parameters. The orbital space auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method is also implemented, enabling cross validation between different highly accurate methods. The code is specifically optimized for calculations with large numbers of electrons on the latest high performance computing architectures, including multicore central processing unit and graphical processing unit systems. We detail the program’s capabilities, outline its structure, and give examples of its use in current research calculations. The package is available at http://qmcpack.org.}^M

  abstract={We describe a stochastic coupled cluster theory which represents excitation amplitudes as discrete
excitors in the space of excitation amplitudes. Reexpressing the coupled cluster (CC) equations as the
dynamics of excitors in this space, we show that a simple set of rules suffices to evolve a distribution of
excitors to sample the CC solution and correctly evaluate the CC energy. These rules are not truncation
specific and this method can calculate CC solutions to an arbitrary level of truncation. We present results
of calculation on the neon atom, and nitrogen and water molecules showing the ability to recover both
truncated and full CC results.}

With such a wave function, the correlation effects can be treated differently in atomic and binding regions. In the case of the FH molecule, no atomic core Jastrow was used and two different valence Jastrow factors (one for the lone pairs paying a role in the bond and the other one for the $\sigma$-bond) were introduced. The resulting binding energy was essentially exact within error bars. Combining the various VB wave functions discussed in this work with this multi-Jastrow approach is presently under investigation.}

Thus, these orbitals vanish exactly only at infinite distance.}

  abstract = {We show that density functional theory within the RPA (random phase
        approximation for the exchange-correlation energy) provides a correct
        description of bond dissociation in H2 in a spin-restricted Kohn-<96>Sham
        formalism, i.e., without artificial symmetry breaking. We present
        accurate adiabatic connection curves both at equilibrium and beyond
        the Coulson-Fisher point. The strong curvature at large bond length
        implies important static (left-<96>right) correlation, justifying modern
        hybrid functional constructions but also demonstrating their limitations.
        Although exact at infinite separation and accurate near the equilibrium
        bond length, the RPA dissociation curve displays unphysical repulsion
        at larger but finite bond lengths. Going beyond the RPA by including
        the exact exchange kernel (RPA + X), we find a similar repulsion.
        We argue that this deficiency is due to the absence of double excitations
        in adiabatic linear response theory. Further analyzing the H2 dissociation
        limit we show that the RPA + X is not size consistent, in contrast
        to the RPA.},

The continuum scattering states are then obtained as a linear combination of these two functions. However, our analysis of complex-energy states remains unchanged.

        theorem with density functional theory. For hexagonal boron nitride
        the in-plane and out-of-plane bonding as well as vibrational dynamics
        are well described both at equilibrium and when the layers are pulled
        apart. Bonding in covalent and ionic solids is also described. The
        formalism allows us to ping down the deficiencies of common exchange-correlation
        functionals and provides insight toward the inclusion of dispersion
        interactions into the correlation functional.}

A simple approximate model of the static response function is visually compared on several examples in order to demonstrate this relationship. This study is completed by illustrating the well-known isomorphism between the exchange hole and the square of the dominant localized orbital lying in the space region of the reference point of the exchange hole function. The implications of these relationships for the interpretation of common chemical concepts, such as delocalization, are discussed. "

	abstract = {Kohn{\textendash}Sham density functional theory is in principle an exact formulation of quantum mechanical electronic structure theory, but in practice we have to rely on approximate exchange{\textendash}correlation (xc) functionals. The objective of our work has been to design an xc functional with broad accuracy across as wide an expanse of chemistry and physics as possible, leading{\textemdash}as a long-range goal{\textemdash}to a functional with good accuracy for all problems, i.e. a universal functional. To guide our path towards that goal and to measure our progress, we have developed{\textemdash}building on earlier work of our group{\textemdash}a set of databases of reference data for a variety of energetic and structural properties in chemistry and physics. These databases include energies of molecular processes, such as atomization, complexation, proton addition and ionization; they also include molecular geometries and solid-state lattice constants, chemical reaction barrier heights, and cohesive energies and band gaps of solids. For this paper, we gather many of these databases into four comprehensive databases, two with 384 energetic data for chemistry and solid-state physics and another two with 68 structural data for chemistry and solid-state physics, and we test two wave function methods and 77 density functionals (12 Minnesota meta functionals and 65 others) in a consistent way across this same broad set of data. We especially highlight the Minnesota density functionals, but the results have broader implications in that one may see the successes and failures of many kinds of density functionals when they are all applied to the same data. Therefore, the results provide a status report on the quest for a universal functional.},

abstract = {We present a dynamical second-order kernel for the Bethe-Salpeter equation to calculate electronic excitation energies. The derivation takes explicitly the functional derivative of the exact second-order self energy with respect to the one-particle Green's function. It includes naturally a frequency dependence, going beyond the adiabatic approximation. Perturbative calculations under the Tamm-Dancoff approximation, using the configuration interaction singles (CIS) eigenvectors, reveal an appreciable improvement over CIS, time-dependent Hartree-Fock, and adiabatic time-dependent density functional theory results. The perturbative results also compare well with equation-of-motion coupled-cluster and experimental results.},

   compute fourteen low-lying potential energy surfaces of the carbon dimer
   using the cc-pV5Z basis set, with an estimated error in energy of 30-50

Abstract = {We extend the recently proposed heat-bath configuration interaction
   (HCI) method {[}Holmes, Tubman, Umrigar, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016,
   12, 3674], by introducing a semistochastic algorithm for performing
   multireference Epstein -Nesbet perturbation theory, in order to
   completely eliminate the severe memory bottleneck of the original
   method. The proposed algorithm has several attractive features. First,
   there is no sign problem that plagues several quantum Monte Carlo
   methods. Second, instead of using Metropolis Hastings sampling, we use
   the Alias method to directly sample determinants from the reference wave
   function, thus avoiding correlations between consecutive samples. Third,
   in addition to removing the memory bottleneck, semistochastic HCI (SHCI)
   is faster than the deterministic variant for many systems if a
   stochastic error of 0.1 mHa is acceptable. Fourth, within the SHCI
   algorithm one can trade memory for a modest increase in computer time.
   Fifth, the perturbative calculation is embarrassingly parallel. The SHCI
   algorithm extends the range of applicability of the original algorithm,
   allowing us to calculate the correlation energy of very large active
   spaces. We demonstrate this by performing calculations on several first
   row dimers including F-2 with an active space of (14e, 108o), Mn-Salen
   cluster with an active space of (28e, 22o), and Cr-2 dimer with up to a
   quadruple-zeta( basis set with an active space of (12e, 190o). For these
   systems we were able to obtain better than 1 mHa accuracy with a wall
   time of merely 55 s, 37 s, and 56 min on 1, 1, and 4 nodes,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {We introduce a new selected configuration interaction plus perturbation
   theory algorithm that is based on a deterministic analog of our recent
   efficient heat-bath sampling algorithm. This Heat-bath Configuration
   Interaction (HCI) algorithm makes use of two parameters that control the
   trade-off between speed and accuracy, one which controls the selection
   of determinants to add to a variational wave function and one which
   controls the selection of determinants used to compute the perturbative
   correction to the variational energy. We show that HCI provides an
   accurate treatment of both static and dynamic correlation by computing
   the potential energy curve of the multireference carbon dimer in the
   cc-pVDZ basis. We then demonstrate the speed and accuracy of HCI by
   recovering the full configuration interaction energy of both the carbon
   dimer in the cc-pVTZ basis and the strongly correlated chromium dimer in
   the Ahlrichs VDZ basis, correlating all electrons, to an accuracy of
   better than 1 mHa, in just a few minutes on a single core. These systems
   have full variational spaces of 3 x 10(14) and 2 x 10(22) determinants,

Abstract = {We introduce an algorithm for sampling many-body
quantum states in Fock space. The algorithm efficiently samples states
with probability approximately proportional to an arbitrary function of the
second-quantized Hamiltonian matrix element connecting the sampled
state to the current state. We apply the new sampling algorithm to the
recently developed semistochastic full configuration interaction quantum
Monte Carlo (S-FCIQMC) method, a semistochastic implementation of
the power method for projecting out the ground state energy in a basis of
Slater determinants. Our new sampling method requires modest additional
computational time and memory compared to uniform sampling but
results in newly spawned weights that are approximately of the same
magnitude, thereby greatly improving the efficiency of projection. A
comparison in efficiency between our sampling algorithm and uniform
sampling is performed on the all-electron nitrogen dimer at equilibrium in Dunning’s cc-pVXZ basis sets with X ∈ {D, T, Q , 5},
demonstrating a large gain in efficiency that increases with basis set size. In addition, a comparison in efficiency is performed on
three all-electron first-row dimers, B$_2$ , N$_2$, and F$_2$, in a cc-pVQZ basis, demonstrating that the gain in efficiency compared to
uniform sampling also increases dramatically with the number of electrons.},

Abstract = {Variational Monte Carlo and various projector Monte Carlo (PMC) methods are presented in a unified manner. Similarities and differences between the methods and choices made in designing the methods are discussed. Both methods where the Monte Carlo walk is performed in a discrete space and methods where it is performed in a continuous space are considered. It is pointed out that the usual prescription for importance sampling may not be advantageous depending on the particular quantum Monte Carlo method used and the observables of interest, so alternate prescriptions are presented. The nature of the sign problem is discussed for various versions of PMC methods. A prescription for an exact PMC method in real space, i.e., a method that does not make a fixed-node or similar approximation and does not have a finite basis error, is presented. This method is likely to be practical for systems with a small number of electrons. Approximate PMC methods that are applicable to larger systems and go beyond the fixed-node approximation are also discussed.},

Journal = {Journal of Computational Physics},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {287},
Abstract = {The computational cost of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of realistic periodic
systems depends strongly on the method of storing and evaluating the many-particle wave
function. Previous work by Williamson et al. (2001) [35] and Alfè and Gillan, (2004) [36]
has demonstrated the reduction of the O ( N 3 ) cost of evaluating the Slater determinant 
with planewaves to O ( N 2 ) using localized basis functions. We compare four polynomial
approximations as basis functions – interpolating Lagrange polynomials, interpolating
piecewise-polynomial-form (pp-) splines, and basis-form (B-) splines (interpolating and 
smoothing). All these basis functions provide a similar speedup relative to the planewave
basis. The pp-splines have eight times the memory requirement of the other methods. To
test the accuracy of the basis functions, we apply them to the ground state structures
of Si, Al, and MgO. The polynomial approximations differ in accuracy most strongly for
MgO, and smoothing B-splines most closely reproduce the planewave value for of the
variational Monte Carlo energy. Using separate approximations for the Laplacian of the
orbitals increases the accuracy sufficiently to justify the increased memory requirement,
making smoothing B-splines, with separate approximation for the Laplacian, the preferred
choice for approximating planewave-represented orbitals in QMC calculations.},

Abstract = {Anions and radicals are important for many applications including environmental chemistry, semi-

coupling limit of the Hohenberg-Kohn functional on the prototypical case of the He isoelectronic
series with varying nuclear charge Z < 2, which includes weakly bound negative ions and a quantum
phase transition at a critical value of Z, representing a big challenge for density functional theory. We
use accurate wavefunction calculations to validate our results, comparing energies and Kohn-Sham
potentials, thus also providing useful reference data close to and at the quantum phase transition. We
show that our functional is able to bind H− and to capture in general the physics of loosely bound
anions, with a tendency to strongly overbind that can be proven mathematically. We also include
corrections based on the uniform electron gas which improve the results.},

Abstract = {A quantum Monte Carlo study of the atomization energies for the G2 set

   With the largest basis set, the mean absolute deviation from

   Optimizing the orbitals within variational Monte Carlo improves the
   agreement between diffusion Monte Carlo and experiment, reducing the
   mean absolute deviation to 2.1 kcal/mol. Moving beyond a single
   determinant Slater-Jastrow trial wavefunction, diffusion Monte Carlo
   with a small complete active space Slater-Jastrow trial wavefunction
   results in near chemical accuracy. In this case, the mean absolute

Abstract = {We present a technique for optimizing hundreds of thousands of

   introducing iterative Krylov subspace solvers and by multiplying by the
   Hamiltonian and overlap matrices as they are sampled, we remove the need
   to construct and store these matrices and thus bypass the most expensive
   steps of the stochastic reconfiguration and linear method optimization
   techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by using
   stochastic reconfiguration to optimize a correlator product state wave
   function with a Pfaffian reference for four example systems. In two
   examples on the two dimensional Fermionic Hubbard model, we study 16 and
   64 site lattices, recovering energies accurate to 1\% in the smaller
   lattice and predicting particle-hole phase separation in the larger. In
   two examples involving an ab initio Hamiltonian, we investigate the
   potential energy curve of a symmetrically dissociated 4 x 4 hydrogen
   lattice as well as the singlet-triplet gap in free base porphin. In the
   hydrogen system we recover 98\% or more of the correlation energy at all

Abstract = {We consider the use in quantum Monte Carlo calculations of two types of
   valence bond wave functions based on strictly localized active orbitals,
   namely valence bond self-consistent-field and breathing-orbital valence
   bond wave functions. Complemented by a Jastrow factor, these
   Jastrow-valence-bond wave functions are tested by computing the
   equilibrium well depths of the four diatomic molecules C2,N-2, O-2, and
   F-2 in both variational Monte Carlo and diffusion Monte Carlo. We show
   that it is possible to design compact wave functions based on chemical
   grounds that are capable of describing both static and dynamic electron
   correlations. These wave functions can be systematically improved by
   inclusion of valence bond structures corresponding to additional bonding
   patterns. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {Basis set construction for molecular electronic structure theory:
   Natural orbital and Gauss-Slater basis for smooth pseudopotentials},

Abstract = {A simple yet general method for constructing basis sets for molecular
   electronic structure calculations is presented. These basis sets consist
   of atomic natural orbitals from a multiconfigurational self-consistent
   field calculation supplemented with primitive functions, chosen such
   that the asymptotics are appropriate for the potential of the system.
   Primitives are optimized for the homonuclear diatomic molecule to
   produce a balanced basis set. Two general features that facilitate this
   basis construction are demonstrated. First, weak coupling exists between
   the optimal exponents of primitives with different angular momenta.
   Second, the optimal primitive exponents for a chosen system depend
   weakly on the particular level of theory employed for optimization. The
   explicit case considered here is a basis set appropriate for the
   Burkatzki-Filippi-Dolg pseudopotentials. Since these pseudopotentials
   are finite at nuclei and have a Coulomb tail, the recently proposed
   Gauss-Slater functions are the appropriate primitives. Double-and
   triple-zeta bases are developed for elements hydrogen through argon.
   These new bases offer significant gains over the corresponding
   Burkatzki-Filippi-Dolg bases at various levels of theory. Using a
   Gaussian expansion of the basis functions, these bases can be employed
   in any electronic structure method. Quantum Monte Carlo provides an
   added benefit: expansions are unnecessary since the integrals are
   evaluated numerically. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {Silicon undergoes a phase transition from the semiconducting diamond
   phase to the metallic beta-Sn phase under pressure. We use quantum Monte
   Carlo calculations to predict the transformation pressure and compare
   the results to density-functional calculations employing the
   local-density approximation, the generalized-gradient approximations
   PBE, PW91, WC, AM05, PBEsol, and the hybrid functional HSE06 for the
   exchange-correlation functional. Diffusion Monte Carlo predicts a
   transition pressure of 14.0 +/- 1.0 GPa slightly above the
   experimentally observed transition pressure range of 11.3-12.6 GPa. The
   HSE06 hybrid functional predicts a transition pressure of 12.4 GPa in
   excellent agreement with experiments. Exchange-correlation functionals
   using the local-density approximation and generalized-gradient
   approximations result in transition pressures ranging from 3.5 to 10.0
   GPa, well below the experimental values. The transition pressure is
   sensitive to stress anisotropy. Anisotropy in the stress along any of
   the cubic axes of the diamond phase of silicon lowers the equilibrium
   transition pressure and may explain the discrepancy between the various
   experimental values as well as the small overestimate of the quantum
   Monte Carlo transition pressure.},

Month = {Mar 7},
Abstract = {Molecular calculations in quantum Monte Carlo frequently employ a mixed
   basis consisting of contracted and primitive Gaussian functions. While
   standard basis sets of varying size and accuracy are available in the
   literature, we demonstrate that reoptimizing the primitive function
   exponents within quantum Monte Carlo yields more compact basis sets for
   a given accuracy. Particularly large gains are achieved for highly
   excited states. For calculations using nondiverging pseudopotentials, we
   introduce Gauss-Slater basis functions that behave as Gaussians at short
   distances and Slaters at long distances. These basis functions further
   improve the energy and fluctuations of the local energy for a given
   basis size. Gains achieved by exponent optimization and Gauss-Slater
   basis use are exemplified by calculations for the ground state of
   carbon, the lowest lying excited states of carbon with (5)S(o), (3)P(o),
   (1)D(o), and (3)F(o) symmetries, carbon dimer, and naphthalene.

Abstract = {We describe correlator product states, a class of numerically efficient
   many-body wave functions to describe strongly correlated wave functions
   in any dimension. Correlator product states introduce direct
   correlations between physical degrees of freedom in a simple way, yet
   provide the flexibility to describe a wide variety of systems. We show
   that many interesting wave functions can be mapped exactly onto
   correlator product states, including Laughlin's quantum Hall wave
   function, Kitaev's toric code states, and Huse and Elser's frustrated

   states and other common families of variational wave functions such as
   matrix product states, tensor product states, and resonating
   valence-bond states. Variational calculations for the Heisenberg and
   spinless Hubbard models demonstrate the promise of correlator product
   states for describing both two-dimensional and fermion correlations.

Abstract = {We pursue the development and application of the recently introduced
   linear optimization method for determining the optimal linear and
   nonlinear parameters of Jastrow-Slater wave functions in a variational
   Monte Carlo framework. In this approach, the optimal parameters are
   found iteratively by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix in the space
   spanned by the wave function and its first-order derivatives, making use
   of a strong zero-variance principle. We extend the method to optimize
   the exponents of the basis functions, simultaneously with all the other
   parameters, namely, the Jastrow, configuration state function, and
   orbital parameters. We show that the linear optimization method can be
   thought of as a so-called augmented Hessian approach, which helps
   explain the robustness of the method and permits us to extend it to
   minimize a linear combination of the energy and the energy variance. We
   apply the linear optimization method to obtain the complete ground-state
   potential energy curve of the C(2) molecule up to the dissociation limit

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, continuum quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) has
   proved to be an invaluable tool for predicting of the properties of
   matter from fundamental principles. By solving the Schrodinger equation
   through a stochastic projection, it achieves the greatest accuracy and
   reliability of methods available for physical systems containing more
   than a few quantum particles. QMC enjoys scaling favorable to quantum
   chemical methods, with a computational effort which grows with the
   second or third power of system size. This accuracy and scalability has
   enabled scientific discovery across a broad spectrum of disciplines. The
   current methods perform very efficiently at the terascale. The quantum
   Monte Carlo Endstation project is a collaborative effort among
   researchers in the field to develop a new generation of algorithms, and
   their efficient implementations, which will take advantage of the
   upcoming petaflop architectures. Some aspects of these developments are
   discussed here. These tools will expand the accuracy, efficiency and
   range of QMC applicability and enable us to tackle challenges which are
   currently out of reach. The methods will be applied to several important
   problems including electronic and structural properties of water,
   transition metal oxides, nanosystems and ultracold atoms.},

Title = {Incipient Wigner localization in circular quantum dots},
Journal = {Phys. Rev. B},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {76},
Number = {8},
Month = {Aug},
Abstract = {We study the development of electron-electron correlations in circular
   quantum dots as the density is decreased. We consider a wide range of
   both electron number, N <= 20, and electron gas parameter, r(s)less than
   or similar to 18, using the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo technique.
   Features associated with correlation appear to develop very differently
   in quantum dots than in bulk. The main reason is that translational
   symmetry is necessarily broken in a dot, leading to density modulation
   and inhomogeneity. Electron-electron interactions act to enhance this
   modulation ultimately leading to localization. This process appears to
   be completely smooth and occurs over a wide range of density. Thus there
   is a broad regime of ``incipient{''} Wigner crystallization in these
   quantum dots. Our specific conclusions are (i) the density develops
   sharp rings while the pair density shows both radial and angular
   inhomogeneity; (ii) the spin of the ground state is consistent with
   Hund's (first) rule throughout our entire range of r(s) for all 4 <= N
   <= 20; (iii) the addition energy curve first becomes smoother as
   interactions strengthen-the mesoscopic fluctuations are damped by
   correlation-and then starts to show features characteristic of the
   classical addition energy; (iv) localization effects are stronger for a
   smaller number of electrons; (v) finally, the gap to certain spin
   excitations becomes small at the strong interaction (large r(s)) side of
   our regime.},

Abstract = {We construct improved quantum Monte Carlo estimators for the spherically

   introduced by Assaraf and Caffarel. The calculation of I(u) is made
   vastly more efficient by replacing the average of the local
   delta-function operator by the average of a smooth nonlocal operator
   that has several orders of magnitude smaller variance. These new
   estimators also reduce the systematic error (or bias) of the intracule
   density due to the approximate trial wave function. Used in combination
   with the optimization of an increasing number of parameters in trial
   Jastrow-Slater wave functions, they allow one to obtain well converged
   correlated intracule densities for atoms and molecules. These ideas can
   be applied to calculating any pair-correlation function in classical or

Volume = {126},
Number = {8},
Month = {Feb 28},
Abstract = {We study three wave function optimization methods based on energy
   minimization in a variational Monte Carlo framework: the Newton, linear,
   and perturbative methods. In the Newton method, the parameter variations
   are calculated from the energy gradient and Hessian, using a reduced
   variance statistical estimator for the latter. In the linear method, the
   parameter variations are found by diagonalizing a nonsymmetric estimator
   of the Hamiltonian matrix in the space spanned by the wave function and
   its derivatives with respect to the parameters, making use of a strong
   zero-variance principle. In the less computationally expensive
   perturbative method, the parameter variations are calculated by
   approximately solving the generalized eigenvalue equation of the linear
   method by a nonorthogonal perturbation theory. These general methods are
   illustrated here by the optimization of wave functions consisting of a
   Jastrow factor multiplied by an expansion in configuration state
   functions (CSFs) for the C(2) molecule, including both valence and core
   electrons in the calculation. The Newton and linear methods are very
   efficient for the optimization of the Jastrow, CSF, and orbital
   parameters. The perturbative method is a good alternative for the
   optimization of just the CSF and orbital parameters. Although the
   optimization is performed at the variational Monte Carlo level, we
   observe for the C(2) molecule studied here, and for other systems we
   have studied, that as more parameters in the trial wave functions are
   optimized, the diffusion Monte Carlo total energy improves
   monotonically, implying that the nodal hypersurface also improves
   monotonically. (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {Properties of the `electron gas' - in which conduction electrons
   interact by means of Coulomb forces but ionic potentials are neglected -
   change dramatically depending on the balance between kinetic energy and
   Coulomb repulsion. The limits are well understood(1). For very weak
   interactions ( high density), the system behaves as a Fermi liquid, with
   delocalized electrons. In contrast, in the strongly interacting limit (
   low density), the electrons localize and order into a Wigner crystal
   phase. The physics at intermediate densities, however, remains a subject
   of fundamental research(2-8). Here, we study the intermediate-density
   electron gas confined to a circular disc, where the degree of
   confinement can be tuned to control the density. Using accurate quantum
   Monte Carlo techniques(9), we show that the electron - electron
   correlation induced by an increase of the interaction first smoothly
   causes rings, and then angular modulation, without any signature of a
   sharp transition in this density range. This suggests that
   inhomogeneities in a confined system, which exist even without
   interactions, are significantly enhanced by correlations.},

Abstract = {Germanium telluride undergoes rapid transition between polycrystalline

   While the crystalline phases are predicted to be semiconductors,
   polycrystalline germanium telluride always exhibits p-type metallic
   conductivity. We present a study of the electronic structure and
   formation energies of the vacancy and antisite defects in both known
   crystalline phases. We show that these intrinsic defects determine the
   nature of free-carrier transport in crystalline germanium telluride.
   Germanium vacancies require roughly one-third the energy of the other
   three defects to form, making this by far the most favorable intrinsic
   defect. While the tellurium antisite and vacancy induce gap states, the
   germanium counterparts do not. A simple counting argument, reinforced by
   integration over the density of states, predicts that the germanium
   vacancy leads to empty states at the top of the valence band, thus
   giving a complete explanation of the observed p-type metallic

Abstract = {The maximum-density droplet of quantum dots in a high magnetic field,

   the hole is as a vortex at the center, which, however, is renormalized

   hole state is achieved in terms of a ``composite-fermion
   antiparticle,{''} which is surprising in view of the fact that composite
   fermions are thought to be relevant only in the fractional Hall regime.
   We extend these considerations to multiple holes in the maximum-density

Abstract = {The exchange-correlation energy in Kohn-Sham density functional theory
   is expressed as a functional of the electronic density and the Kohn-Sham
   orbitals. An alternative to Kohn-Sham theory is to express the energy as
   a functional of the reduced first-order density matrix or equivalently
   the natural orbitals. We present an approximate, simple, and
   parameter-free functional of the natural orbitals, based solely on
   scaling arguments and the near satisfaction of a sum rule. Our tests on
   atoms show that it yields on average more accurate energies and charge
   densities than the Hartree-Fock method, the local density approximation,
   and the generalized gradient approximations.},

Abstract = {The wave function usually employed in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
   electronic structure calculations is the product of a Jastrow factor and
   a sum of products of up-spin and down-spin determinants. Typically, a
   different Jastrow factor is used for parallel- and antiparallel-spin
   electrons in order to satisfy the cusp conditions and thereby ensure
   that the local energy at electron-electron coincidence points is finite.
   However, when the Jastrow factor is not completely symmetric under
   interchange of the spatial coordinates of the electrons, the resulting
   wave function may not be an eigenstate of the spill operator (S) over
   cap(2). For the Li and Be atoms, we evaluate the spin contamination in a
   variety of wave functions with progressively higher body-order
   correlations in the Jastrow factor. The spin contamination is found to
   be small for all the wave functions (10(-3)-10(-5)), the smaller values
   being obtained for the more accurate wave functions. On the other hand,
   if we eliminate the spin contamination by employing asymmetric Jastrow
   (and sacrificing the parallel-spin cusp condition), the resulting wave
   functions typically have about 20\%-40\% larger root mean square
   fluctuations in the local energy. A wave function which both satisfies
   the cusp conditions and has definite spin can be constructed, but for
   systems with many electrons, its computational cost is higher than for
   the commonly used QMC wave functions. (C) 1995 American Institute of

Abstract = {We consider two perturbative schemes to calculate excitation energies,
   each employing the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian as the unperturbed system.
   Using accurate exchange-correlation potentials generated from
   essentially exact densities and their exchange components determined by
   a recently proposed method, we evaluate energy differences between the
   groundstate and excited states in first-order perturbation theory for
   the helium, ionized lithium and beryllium atoms. It was recently
   observed that the zeroth-order excitations energies, simply given by the
   difference of the Kohn-Sham eigenvalues, almost always lie between the
   singlet and triplet experimental excitations energies, corrected for
   relativistic and finite nuclear mass effects. The first-order
   corrections provide about a factor of two improvement in one of the
   perturbative schemes but not in the other. The excitation energies
   within perturbation theory are found to be more accurate than the
   excitations obtained within Delta SCF while, for a two-electron system,
   they coincide with the ones obtained in time-dependent density
   functional theory within the single-pole approximation using our
   accurate static exchange-correlation potential and the time-dependent
   optimized effective potential kernel. We find that the agreement between
   the experimental and the perturbative excitation energies deteriorates
   significantly if potentials from approximate functionals such as the
   local density approximation and the optimized effective potential method
   are employed instead of the true Kohn-Sham potential. (C) 1997 American

Abstract = {Identities for the electron intracule density I(R) in atoms and
   molecules are derived within the Hiller-Sucher-Feinberg (HSF) formalism.
   It is proven that, when applied to arbitrary (exact or approximate)
   electronic wave functions, these identities produce intracule densities
   that satisfy a modified condition for the electron coalescence cusp. A
   corollary of this proof provides a new, simplified derivation of the
   cusp condition for the exact I(R). An expression for the Hartree-Fock
   approximation to the HSF electron intracule density that contains only
   two- and three-electron terms is obtained and its properties are
   analyzed. A simple scaling of the three-electron contributions in this
   expression assures integrability of the approximate I(R) and improves
   its overall accuracy. Numerical tests carried out for the H-, He, Li+,
   Be2+, Li, and Be systems demonstrate that the application of the scaled
   HSF-type identity to Hartree-Fock wave functions affords dramatic
   improvements in the short-range behavior of the electron intracule
   density. (C) 1995 American Institute of Physics.},
