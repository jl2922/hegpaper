We apply the recently developed fast semistochastic heat-bath configuration interaction (SHCI) to homogeneous electron gas (HEG) system in the mid-to-high density regime.
In this regime, the basis-set incompleteness error is the dominating error for second quantization based methods and SHCI works well with large basis sets.
To obtain highly accurate results, we use up to 39,886 orbitals, which are more than an order of magnitude more than previous state-of-the-art calculations with essentially exact methods.
This reduces the basis set incompleteness error significantly and gives much more accurate and reliable extrapolated results for complete basis sets.
We calculate HEG correlation energies for both the 14-electron and 54-electron supercell cases with effective radius $r_s$ ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 and compare our results with previous methods.
