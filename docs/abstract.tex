We apply the recently developed fast semistochastic heatbath configuration interaction (SHCI) to the homogeneous electron gas (HEG) in the mid-to-high density regime.
In this regime, the basis-set incompleteness error is the dominant error for second quantization based methods
%and SHCI works well with large basis sets.
so we extend the SHCI method to handle large basis sets.
To obtain highly accurate results, we use up to 39,886 orbitals, which is more than an order of magnitude larger than
% previous state-of-the-art calculations with essentially exact methods.
the number used in previous state-of-the-art calculations using methods that yield essentially exact results
within a basis set.
%This reduces the basis set incompleteness error significantly and gives much more accurate and reliable extrapolated results for complete basis sets.
This enables accurate extrapolation to the complete basis set limit.
We calculate HEG correlation energies for both the 14-electron and 54-electron supercell cases with Wigner-Seitz radius $r_s$ ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 and compare our results with previous methods.
