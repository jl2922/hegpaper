\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we apply our fast semistochastic heat-bath configuration interaction algorithm (SHCI) to the homongenous electron gas (HEG) problem in the mid to high density region.
The basis set incompleteness error is a dominating error in this region, and the uncertainty of the result depends a lot on the uncertainty of the extrapolation, which in terms depends on the extrapolation distance.
By using SHCI with up to 39886 orbitals, we reduce the extrapolation distance significantly and achieves more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods.
